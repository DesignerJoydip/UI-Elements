        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-40">HOW THE <i>INSPIRED HEART® LETTERS</i> EVOLVED</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is the tragic tale of a humble man.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Well over one hundred years ago Edmond Rostand wrote the famous play Cyrano de Bergerac. Cyrano had a burning desire
            to win the heart of the lovely Roxanne. However, Cyrano was intimidated by his own sense of inadequacy. Rather
            than reveal his desire openly, Cyrano assists Christian, her more handsome suitor, in capturing Roxanne’s affections
            by writing exquisitely romantic, seductive letters for Christian to woo her with. They are the very words, the
            heartfelt letters
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="mb-10">alone that caused Roxanne to fall in love.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I have helped families, couples, and individuals to be more open, honest, and to face underlying truths in order
            to move forward with much more strength or resiliency. Over fifteen years ago, I began helping clients in a unique
            way, by actually writing letters to their significant others for them, when they felt too self-conscious or bewildered
            to do it themselves. As I began to compile results, this approach became validated, as I could see my clients
            gain more successful connections with others. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Similar to Cyrano de Bergerac, while I am easily and compassionately able to construct effective letters that enhance
            romance, romantic or love relationships are just one of the many realms for which I write. Letters can be written
            for any relationship situation. In my experience, many of these thoughtfully crafted <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i>            are perfect for any relationship matter where there is a need to share and accept the truth, gain respect, mark
            a boundary, forgive and release a painful memory, or propose a solution. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My daughter is now a young adult. She still knows how to charm me by creating whimsical cards and writing her own
            heartfelt sentiments. Just like me, most parents have kept every card or letter their children have ever written.Teachers</p>

        </div>

        <p class="mb-10">line their classrooms or offices with cards, and cherish every letter received from their students and their parents.
            Letters of appreciation from co-workers, clients, or bosses are never tossed out. Likewise, when we receive a
            letter from anyone we hold dear, we feel appreciated. Loving, romantic, thoughtful cards commemorate birthdays,
            special events, Valentine’s Day, and other significant holidays. We feel honored by receiving special cards and
            their messages. Even “just thinking of you” cards are treasured as symbols of love or endearment. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Words are like magic wands; they can destroy or build, having the power to damage or heal. For those able to stay
            connected in another’s heart, words can transform any disparaging emotion to a more blissful outcome. Therefore,
            we must take responsibility for the words we express.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Nevertheless, some of us have difficulty finding the right words to powerfully convey what is in our heart and on
            our mind. Although we may be sharp-tongued, witty, and have an abundance of expressive language skills, that’s
            not enough to communicate the words that will be received effectively by someone else and help the relationship.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">So, what is it that often gets in the way of this kind of true communication? We do. We get in our own way despite
            good intentions, knowledge, insight, and excellent language skills! </p>

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is one thing to write from an analytical perspective with wellorganized, clear-cut language to determine the current
            issue. There may even be a viable solution addressed. However, when there is no heart-based communication, the
            receiver feels the void and is not emotionally moved by the letter. Conversely, if a letter is filled with emotion,
            often the letter lacks enough logic or does not offer a practical way to approach and move beyond the pain or
            sentiments to find a meaningful solution. More importantly, when one tries to write a meaningful letter in order
            to alleviate an emotional issue with another, all too often the elements of ego, history, and raw emotional wounds
            conflict with the true intention, or what should be conveyed to obtain the best outcome. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Feeling emotionally stuck, not knowing just how to soften and repair a difficult problem, can feel pretty exhausting,
            aggravating, or overwhelming. Let me show you a way to deepen your connections, resolve emotional or situational
            conflicts, and feel satisfied – even relieved – that you took the time, with thoughtful consideration, and spoke
            from your heart.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Throughout this book, the intuitive letters I write for others will be referred to as <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i>.
            I have come to realize that the words expressed in these transformative messages are indeed channeled through
            spirit. These letters are in accordance with the power of manifestation.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In order to create a desired outcome, or allow something even better to occur, I prescribe the following recipe:
            First, see the inspiration to share your thoughts and feelings as an invocation of the purest of intentions.
            The action that is called for is when your intention or prayer is expressed in written form, or otherwise, what
            is referred to as the letter, is actually given to an intended recipient. Then, the emotions that are inspired
            by the letter itself are deeply felt and guided by the law of attraction. This seems to create a stirring, a
            newfound clarity, and a sense of peace. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once the letter is given, often the communicator feels a sense of relief. More than that, an energetic shift occurs,
            and the situation at hand becomes more aligned. Although a particular outcome may seem different than what was
            originally intended or hoped for, surely a difference is made, and what is in Divine order does come to pass.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The beauty of the written word, or receiving a communication by letter, is that the recipient is so much more available
            to absorb or hear what is being said. The power of the</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">written word simply cannot be underestimated. What is written and then read can be mused over and reconsidered. There
            are no interruptions as you may experience in a conversation. There are no emotional defenses that may shroud
            a personal exchange. The words can be re-read for better understanding and reflection. There is an opportunity
            for time to pass and allow for contemplation. Most importantly, the written letter is the closest instrument
            for sharing a clear, precise communication.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A compelling letter serves as a self-empowerment tool allowing you to gain more successful connections with others.
            The expansive repertoire of Inspired Heart Letters includes themes such as writing to a former spouse in order
            to create a better co-parenting relationship and/or heal the wounds from a separation or divorce, creating a
            more harmonious family life for the children, to children from parents, in order to explain a family circumstance,
            mark a boundary, or gain more respect, and/or from those who need to forgive and release a painful memory. Some
            of these letters allow for a closure to take place that retains dignity and grace, creating a space for each
            party to more easily move forward with less emotional trauma or pain. Other letters have been written to another
            after years of no communication due to a disconnection or severe rift.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Some inspired messages simply call attention to an emotional issue that may be too difficult to express in conversation.
            Among the repertoire of enlightened messages are heartfelt poems, song lyrics, as well as a guided outline to
            follow for verbal conflict resolution. In sum, these letters can address any emotional challenge or convey the
            underlying truth of what might lie heavy in your heart. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There is often a magical transformation that occurs when your heart’s desires are truly expressed. Although I have
            been the instrument for writing the letter, it is actually quite more than an intuitive process, and requires
            that I draw from my experience and training as a family therapist to apprehend the best solutions for my clients.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I try to get to know a bit about my clients beyond just their care or concerns which they hope I can address on their
            behalf. Our interviews are intimate, which allows me to absorb their essence so that I convey their thoughts
            and feelings authentically. How many times have you spoken to a good friend and they suddenly interrupt you as
            you are giving them your feedback, and they exclaim, “That’s exactly what I mean!” The letters seem to align
            or vibrate taking on the personality of the individual sending the letter and his or her</p>

        <p class="mb-10">particular communication style. Graciously, I am able to empathize and actually feel the pain involved in any given
            circumstance. After witnessing the wonderful, often profound results of this process, I am convinced these Inspired
            Heart Letters are essentially downloaded through me from the Divine in order to touch the heart of others. Often,
            tears have rolled down my cheeks as I am writing. I feel the sweetness, the underlying sadness, and the unending
            feelings of remorse, the sense of rejection, and the hope and vision for solving a situation in the best possible
            way.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As I mentioned, a real sense of peace and deeper understanding develops once a letter has been written. There are
            times when that is all that was needed to have a better sense of clarity and a shift in perspective. If just
            reading the letter is enough to invoke a clear understanding followed by a new realization, I advise the client
            to keep the letter to re-read and support their new insights. Many times this releases anguish and causes the
            confusion to simply vanish.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My ever growing library of these ghostwritten letters is precious and exquisite to me. They are formidable as each
            seems to have a life of its own. They each hold keys for healing within their matrix. For the purpose of sharing
            these letters, I have assigned a catchy phrase to remind me of the story behind its creation. </p>

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-40">“PETERED-OUT ON PETER PAN”</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Isabella, a very pretty, petite, middle-aged woman of Italian descent with beautiful blue eyes, dark wavy hair, who
            possessed an outgoing personality and an outrageous laugh, once asked me to write a letter to Danny, her first
            love (whom she’d had a crush on since high school). Although Isabella had been married twice, she was now divorced
            and raising two sons. She always carried this fantasy, or notion, of this former high school sweetheart and what
            “might have been.” In fact, she ran into Danny at her thirtieth high school reunion. A mutual attraction was
            still there and they rekindled their romance. However, there was a snag. Danny was struggling with his long-term
            involvement with another woman.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Danny’s relationship with this other woman was apparently quite sickly. Isabella described this woman as controlling
            and manipulative. Even though Danny already knew it was poisonous, he could not entirely extricate himself from
            their sordid romance. In spite of his emotional baggage, Isabella continued to see Danny, all the while hoping
            he would finally end his involvement with this other woman.</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">

            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">23 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">During this time, Isabella became increasingly confused and anxious. In essence, she thought “If only he would leave
            that woman once and for all, then surely Danny and I could sail off into the sunset and live happily ever after!”
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When I inquired about Danny’s past regarding his experience with healthy bonding and his overall relationship track
            record, Isabella shared that Danny had been divorced for several years. His mother, a single parent, raised him
            after his father abandoned them when he was a very young child. He left home when he was a teenager and had made
            his way through life on his own. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The following is an Inspired Heart Letter to Danny from Isabella. Her intention was to try to reach him through this
            letter in such a way that would compel him to finally free himself from his other dysfunctional relationship
            and choose to devote himself only to her:</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Interestingly, after reading this “Danny Boy” <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>, Isabella’s reaction was as follows:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The minute I read the letter, I burst into tears. It became crystal clear to me how emotionally immature Danny was.
            I also realized just how unhealthy it was for me to stand on the sidelines, “twisting in the wind”, wishing things
            would change. I saw the situation through new eyes. I no longer felt stuck. I was able to easily walk away</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While most of us contend with personal issues or have emotional baggage that we bring into our relationships, it
            is important to recognize what those obstacles are, then work toward healing past conditions and traumas that
            are keeping us down. I advocate that, in considering a new relationship, we acknowledge the baggage. However,
            it is best to seek partners who have a lighter load, or as I put it, “Only have one carry-on bag. Beyond that,
            any additional baggage is just too costly.”
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As a side note, Isabella continued to forgive herself and have compassion for why she had created a tendency toward
            unhealthy relationship drama. This brought awareness for what type of love connection she wanted to attract.
            She telephoned me recently to share that she is quite happy; she’s enjoying a healthy, exclusive relationship
            with a terrific guy. Actually, I attended their wedding last summer.</p>

            form, or come to understand the do’s and don’ts of writing a meaningful, compelling letter. More importantly,
            through the many vignettes discussed in the following chapters, you’ll discover the common, universal themes
            found in relationship challenges. And, you’ll begin to realize how so many people experience the same issues
            over and over again. Circumscribed within these difficult experiences is an emerging wisdom that holds promise
            for new understanding. A cleansing takes place and the psychic wound begins to heal. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While a wonderful letter may open the opportunity to heal a broken heart or a painful emotional situation, there
            is also an immeasurable reward that surfaces once you have achieved a true sense of closure. Misunderstandings,
            old resentments, or any unfinished business around your relationship matter can be cleaned up and finally put
            to rest when you are able to convey a noble salute to honor the experience and leave the situation behind once
            and for all. Otherwise, there is a chance you may find it difficult to move forward. It is not about having the
            last word; instead it is about finalizing and letting go or gracefully releasing any further negative</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Recently, I was going through my garage full speed ahead with a concerted effort to purge or de-clutter by discovering,
            sorting, and donating or recycling whatever hidden mysteries were packed inside boxes over the years. Well, much
            to my sheer delight, I ran across a letter that my lovely daughter, Alana, had written to me when she was in
            elementary school, around the age of 7 or 8. She is now a young woman in her twenties and also the wonderful
            mother of my adorable baby grandson, Everett.

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Just who is this formidable scribe? As one dedicated to helping people achieve health in their relationships, friends
            and even acquaintances want to pick my brain. Often, they are compelled to share with me very private information,
            including their relationship concerns. I enjoy my life’s path steeped in helping others find solutions and gather
            powerful insights. It started as a young child; I was strongly empathetic, even able to physically feel the pain
            of others. In elementary school, I recall standing up to bullies to protect fellow schoolmates who were being
            victimized. Growing up, my family often described me as overly sensitive and pretty spunky. It’s simply my feeling
            nature that continues fueling my quest to better understand just how to resolve difficult matters of the heart.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Perhaps more so than most, I experienced an array of relationship conflicts throughout my lifetime. Although I never
            had a tendency to hold a grudge for long, I was deeply saddened or bothered by any rift in my relationships.
            Yet, at times it was best to simply walk away or disengage from counter-productive or toxic connections. Some
            situations called for clear, unabashed communication, while other relationship issues were better resolved through

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“INITIATION AS A SCRIBE”</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I wrote the very first <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> after a friend and neighbor, Janie, called me complaining about
            a lovely man she had recently met. Jim was an attorney who was obviously quite enamored with her. He had left
            cards, flowers, candy, even balloons and teddy bears at her doorstep. However, Janie was not the least bit interested
            in dating him. She did exclaim how generous, kind, and interesting a person Jim was. Moreover, she did not want
            to hurt his feelings and would enjoy having him become a platonic friend. Actually, she was struggling with a
            personal legal matter and hoped he could help her by providing free legal advice. First, I suggested she have
            a clear-cut conversation with him, since it was certainly detrimental to keep stringing him along under false
            pretenses. Surely, we must treat others as we want to be treated.

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">to more drama and emotional dissatisfaction for all concerned. Janie listened to my advice, yet felt somewhat embarrassed
            and emotionally weak. She could not bring herself to discuss her true desires in a direct conversation. I suggested
            she simply send him an email, although that may seem cold, or better yet, write a short letter and mail it. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Janie attempted to write a letter to her suitor, Jim. When I read the letter; her words came across as whiny, pathetic,
            and groveling. I told Janie that her letter would probably be received with offense rather than as an opening
            for companionship, gratitude, and honor that showed her appreciation, or how she valued Jim as a person worthy
            of friendship. Janie was impressed with my response and lamented that she simply did not have the talent or wherewithal
            to compose such a dynamic letter. At that point, I agreed to ghostwrite her letter, and if she approved, she
            could sign the letter and send it off to Jim. Janie was thrilled at this prospect. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In creating this letter, I easily grasped the issues at hand, and empathized with the situation by considering Janie’s
            motives and higher intention. I was able intuitively, and with practicality, to predict Jim’s feeling response
            to this letter written on Janie’s behalf. The results of the letter seemed to satisfy Janie’s situation. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although this letter was written many years ago, to this</p>

        <p class="mb-10">day, Jim and Janie enjoy a light-hearted friendship. Shortly after receiving the letter, Jim provided Janie with
            more than simple legal advice. He wrote the necessary legal letter and provided paperwork that resolved her legal
            predicament.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Janie, always the socialite, began speaking about her letter’s spectacular results with her many friends. Not only
            did Janie ask me to write more letters on her behalf, but also her friends began calling for letters and advice.
            I cannot begin to say how much satisfaction I have derived from this intuitive letter-writing service. Many of
            these success stories that I am so excited to share with you will be revealed throughout this book. Each letter
            is a jewel, a magical way of connecting to the actual heart of the matter. They seemed to energetically send
            out a positive signal that proved over and over to transform the stress surrounding a relationship matter into
            wonderful, healing results! </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Often, it’s difficult to communicate what we need; yet doing so is necessary for our integrity, or at least, to release
            pent-up emotions. Sometimes deal breakers occur, and we need to prepare for that possibility. In that event,
            we must take stock of what is healthy and decide if a situation is sustainable under current conditions. The
            consequences of committing to decisive steps may be heartbreaking, but the</p>

        <p class="mb-20">choices made must be viewed as yielding to the ultimate best result in the long run. Ryan and Marsha’s story illustrates
            some of these principles.</p>
        <h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">Ryan’s Story </h3>
        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“FIFTY SHADES OF GREEN”</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One of the most frustrating and disturbing issues that can occur within a loving, romantic relationship is when one
            partner suddenly turns into someone else. Imagine if the person you thought you knew unexpectedly morphed into
            another person with a less attractive personality. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ryan thought he had found true love with his girlfriend Marsha. After six months of courting her, Ryan proposed,
            and the couple made plans to wed the following year. Ryan was a proud, ambitious man, who had built a thriving
            business as a prominent commercial real estate investor. He was a fun-loving, charismatic person who loved a
            variety of activities, such as traveling, golf, playing jazz tunes on his saxophone, and hanging out at the local
            country club with friends.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ryan had met Marsha while playing in a mixed doubles tennis match. He was immediately quite taken with how</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">37 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">Marsha carried herself in a social setting; she knew how to engage everyone present. And it didn’t hurt, from Ryan’s
            point of view, that Marsha had lovely legs along with a tanned and toned physique. Ryan considered Marsha to
            be both amazingly athletic and beautifully feminine. More than that, he was exceedingly drawn to her sweet, attentive,
            and cuddly nature, which he found irresistible. They seemed to make a really great combo connecting in the most
            natural, wonderful way. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">According to Ryan, Marsha had worked on and off in retail sales. Her parents had left her a moderate trust fund several
            years earlier. Marsha enjoyed a more relaxed lifestyle and was not very inclined to build a career for herself.
            Ryan was not concerned in the least; he was well-established financially and simply looked forward to enjoying
            more quality time with his bride to be. Their first year together was especially fun. Ryan and Marsha sailed
            to romantic destinations such as Bali and Australia. They also attended many local social gatherings and hosted
            their own dinner parties. However, soon their relationship started to unravel. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For no apparent reason that Ryan could name, Marsha started calling or text messaging him on his cell phone more
            frequently, often waking him up by calling late at night, “just</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
            <p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 38 </p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">to make sure he was alright.” Once, while they were dining at a local hangout, Marsha accused Ryan of ogling another
            woman. At first he thought it was funny and just shook it off. However, soon after, they attended a company Christmas
            party at his firm. When Marsha met his new secretary, Lauren, she acted quite rude and condescending toward her.
            On the way home, Marsha told Ryan to fire the secretary since she did not get a very good “vibe” from the woman.
            Ryan took offense to her comment, and they argued during the entire ride home. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although they saw each other on a fairly regular basis, Ryan was often busy at night, dining with prospective clients
            or business investors. Unfortunately, Marsha began grilling him about these evenings. She wanted to know exactly
            who the clients were, where they ate dinner, why he was out so late, how many cocktails they had and so on. Ryan’s
            secretary reported that once when she returned from lunch she found Marsha in the secretary’s office, seated
            at her desk, checking messages on her computer. Another time, Ryan spied Marsha’s car parked at the corner near
            his house. She quickly drove off when he opened his front door. When Ryan confronted Marsha and essentially told
            her to “back off,” she retaliated in a fit of anger complaining that he must be cheating on her since he did
            not always answer her calls. </p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ryan had originally considered Marsha to be a hot, sexy lover, and a delightful partner. Now he saw her as not only
            silly but rather annoying and even somewhat creepy. In essence, Ryan was beginning to feel trapped, finding himself
            on the defensive much of the time, and pretty stressed out, especially if he happened to miss one of her calls
            (as he did not want to experience Marsha’s backlash for not picking up the phone in time). </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">From Ryan’s perspective, Marsha’s behaviors made no sense. He had spent so many years focused on building his business
            and fortune that he had waited to settle down. Marsha was the first woman he had really desired to make a life
            with. Ryan contacted me, hoping to turn their relationship around before it ended in disaster. And so… the letter
            <i>50 Shades of Green</i> was born. (I am not talking about an Irish golf course!)</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although this was a very difficult message, Ryan took responsibility for what he felt was quickly becoming a defeating
            situation and was out of sync with his heart. This couple did end up taking some time out, hoping they might
            course-correct and find their way back to a new, healthier beginning. The last I heard, Marsha was seeking counseling.
            Hopefully, she is learning to see the truth of her self-sabotaging insecure thoughts and behaviors, along with
            her inability to allow herself the luxury of simply trusting that life can work out and that she is worthy of
            true love. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Since this <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> was written from Ryan’s experience, let’s consider Marsha’s perspective.
            Perhaps she was feeling ignored or left out since Ryan’s professional life had become more time consuming, especially
            within the

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">first few months after their engagement. Maybe Marsha was disappointed because she continued to expect Ryan’s nonstop
            attention after the initial courting phase. This may have triggered a sense of fear, separation anxiety, suspicion,
            or mistrust.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When one partner becomes too needy, the other partner often will begin to experience distress. This could be rooted
            in an inability to satisfy their mate’s relentless drive to solve “What’s wrong with this picture?” Possessive,
            jealous behavior is a symptom of a deeper, pervasive sense of fear and mistrust. This desperate neediness of
            one partner pushes the other partner away. It feels like a heavy anchor and, left unchecked, it eventually drowns
            out every ounce of joy. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In any case, Ryan and Marsha’s relationship was beginning to fall apart. Sneaky or passive-aggressive acts such as
            snooping through private emails and phone messages, throwing a temper tantrum, making assumptions or accusations,
            or demanding anything from a partner is a quick route to the end of the road. However, by staying open while
            expressing how you are feeling without blame, and checking in with your significant other through inquiry instead
            of through paranoid accusations or beliefs is often effective for clearing the air. </p>

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“HEALING LETTER STORY”</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A very powerful and life altering letter-writing experience occurred many years ago, after I was contacted by Tina,
            a lovely, vivacious single mother. At the time, Tina was trying to help her elderly father, Henry, to finally
            enjoy a long-awaited sense of peace over his irrepressible resentment toward one of Tina’s sisters, Karen. Without
            going into too much detail, let’s just say Karen had financially duped their Dear Old Dad and absconded with
            most of his life savings, which was quite a sizable sum of money. Moreover, while their father was assigned to
            Karen’s care, she managed to control him through terrible threats, neglect, caustic remarks and other types of
            manipulative subterfuge.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It was quite an ordeal for Tina to finally rescue Henry from this terrible and sad situation. Fortunately, Tina was
            able to relocate him out of state and closer to her home where she was able to provide a much healthier lifestyle.
            At any rate, her father struggled daily with the notion that Karen,</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">one of his children, took advantage of him financially, and mistreated him. What Henry felt was even more distressing
            was the thought that this conniving daughter would get away with it, and there was nothing he could really do,
            (short of spending the few years he had left battling her in court). Nevertheless, Henry simply could not emotionally
            let it go. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For at least two years, nearly every day Henry worried and complained about Karen, for what she had done. Finally,
            after Tina spoke with her other siblings, she approached me for help. I suggested that they help their dad to
            write his own open, honest letter to Karen, their “mean sister.” This way, he could not only air his feelings,
            but arrive at a better sense of closure. So, I interviewed Henry, took some notes, as well as gathered notes
            from Tina and her other siblings, and formulated the Dad’s having the Last Word letter. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The results of this gesture were astounding. Once Henry mailed that letter, his whole demeanor seemed to instantly
            change. He never spoke of the disheartening situation ever again. It was as though Henry could finally move on
            enjoying his own sense of integrity. The letter was Henry’s gesture for telling the truth and for letting his
            daughter, Karen, know that she had not fooled anyone. What’s more, for posterity’s sake, the cruel daughter could
            not put a different spin on</p>

        <p class="mb-10">what had happened. She could not tell a different story. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">The letter, signed by Henry was his last word to Karen and evidence of her elder abuse. After sending the letter,
            Henry never saw or heard from Karen ever again. Henry passed away in 2007. This sad story did not have a happy
            ending other than to say the letter proved to be a powerful elixir that helped Tina’s father to recover from
            his grief and feel more at peace.

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“REMEMBER THAT SHOVEL? DIG THIS!“</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Dana had been in a challenging relationship with John for over three years. As Dana described it, they had a steamy
            love/hate relationship. At times, John became argumentative and physically aggressive toward her. Yet, their
            sexual attraction and overwhelming sense of passion maintained or perhaps energized their otherwise unhealthy,
            disturbed connection.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, while they vacationed in Hawaii, John and Dana argued over something ridiculous. It was shortly after sunset
            on a remote beach in Kauai. John grabbed Dana and threw</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">her down, pulled her hair, and pushed her face into the sand. Dana had never fought back before. However, this time
            a sense of rage and disgust washed over her. She spied a large, plastic shovel nearby, most likely abandoned
            by some child who had been making a sand castle earlier in the day. Without giving it a second thought, Dana
            grabbed the shovel and began whacking John across the face with it. John was stunned since Dana normally engaged
            only in verbal attacks when provoked. She had never responded before with physical force. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although those shovel whacks certainly stung, John was not seriously injured. After this session of repeated blows,
            the fight finally ended. They decided to break off their relationship once and for all. Or so it seemed.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Like so many cycles of domestic violence, Dana and John eventually got back together. The typical cycle starts with
            a violent or tumultuous incident; then, one partner leaves. Next, the couple finds their way back to one another
            and begins a so-called honeymoon phase. Usually, the instigator manipulates the situation to get back in their
            partner’s arms, pledging remorse and vowing never to commit another assault. However, most often, the honeymoon
            phase ends with yet another violent episode, causing the couple to disengage</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">before returning back to start the cycle over again.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Eventually, Dana and John began seeing one another and their relationship appeared normal for several months. Since
            they both enjoyed romantic getaways, John invited Dana on a ten-day vacation at a beautiful ocean resort in Cabo
            San Lucas, Baja California. The first couple of days went well. Then, after dinner one night, they returned to
            their suite where John continued to drink copious amounts of tequila. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Suddenly, John started insulting Dana and complaining about their relationship. The situation escalated. He started
            punching her in the face and kicking her in the stomach. When he finished battering her, she was lying curled
            up on the floor in the corner of the room overwhelmed and scared for her life. She had a black eye, various bruises,
            and her lip was swollen and cut from his ring. </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Because they were in Mexico, (at the time Mexico’s law enforcement had a reputation for rather nefarious practices
            and unfair treatment of so-called <i>Gringos</i>), Dana felt too afraid and intimidated to call the local police.
            John’s rage seemed to finally subside after this; the couple didn’t speak of it again. However, about a week
            later, after Dana was finally home in Southern California, she decided she never wished to see John again. </p>

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Dana was very afraid since his violence escalated with each new attack. She was so fearful of being viciously attacked
            again that she not only resolved to end the relationship, but sought a legal restraining order. However, the
            local police department informed her she should have filed a complaint in Mexico, rather than to have waited
            a week to file for a restraining order once she was stateside. Nevertheless, they took her statement and photographs
            of her week-old injuries even though she couldn’t proceed with seeking legal protection.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Approximately six weeks later, the local district attorney contacted Dana. Serendipitously, they had discovered that
            another woman had previously filed a complaint accusing John of physical aggression and battering some time ago.
            Dana was told the DA was directly involved now and a formal complaint was in the works. John was arrested and
            held for a hefty $10,000 bail; a trial date was also set.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Dana became panicky at the thought of John’s arrest. She worried he would accuse her of seeking revenge because nearly
            two months had passed since their encounter in Mexico and subsequent breakup. She strongly felt he might stalk
            her and punish her one way or another for putting him through this ordeal. </p>

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">By the time I wrote Dana’s letter to John, he had already left numerous phone messages. Dana had not responded. As
            soon as she read the <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> I had composed for John on her behalf, Dana felt a deep sense
            of relief. She carried a copy in her purse, taking it out and reading it several times as she found the words
            to be a source of comfort that strengthened her resolve. Soon after, Dana packed up some personal belongings
            John had previously left at her home and placed them into a bag with the <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> attached.
            She waited until she knew he was not at home to drop the package on his doorstep. </p>
