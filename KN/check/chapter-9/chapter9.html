        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-40">CELEBRATION OF LIFE:<br> EULOGIES FOR BITTER & SWEET GOODBYES</h4>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When I am requested to write an <i>Inspired Heart Eulogy</i>, I am deeply honored. Eulogies mark the culmination
            of one’s heartfelt feelings that serve to honor the life of a loved one. It is the final publicly pronounced
            farewell. In the event of an unexpected passing, the loved ones left behind may be shocked, overwhelmed, and
            unprepared. Their own mourning consumes them, leaving them little time or energy to actually contemplate just
            how to say goodbye in the most</p>

        <p class="mb-10">meaningful, loving way</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">To me, the most unbearable circumstance occurs when a parent loses a child. I once volunteered to write a prayer
            for a six-year-old girl with a serious illness. She was undergoing a bone-marrow transplant, and I just had a
            feeling she was going to transition soon after, which she did. I was so intrigued by her name. That little girl’s
            name was Patience. I found myself contemplating the meaning of her name and in what way it may have symbolized
            an unrealized gift to her family in terms of teaching them the true meaning of patience, which is graceful endurance.
            I wrote this short poem in her honor:</p>

        </div>

        <p class="align_center mb-10"><i>As you fly away like a dove<br>
                You always live in my heart<br>
                Where I hold you dearly, My Love<br>
                We will never be apart</i></p>

        <p class="align_center mb-10"><i>Your life held such meaning<br>
                It was my blessing just to know you<br>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Learning patience is often more challenging than one can imagine. It can be devastating to stand by feeling helpless
            while our world falls apart and unfortunate, sad, inexplicable events occur. However, to be patient, more importantly,
            includes maintaining a deep, unshakable trust. When we can trust that there is a Divine plan, and to all things
            that occur, there is a purpose – whether or not that purpose eludes us and remains a mystery – then we can let
            go of fear. Even when an innocent child transitions in death, leaving the parents overcome with grief to mourn
            and then to try to pick up the pieces in order to move on in that unfathomable experience, there is a profound
            lesson that challenges our faith.</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This creates an opportunity for those left behind to expand their aching hearts, to come to terms with their own
            vulnerability, and, in time, to succumb to life’s precarious, unpredictable, if not shocking, situations with
            a final acceptance that all is in <i>Divine</i> order. The one constant in life’s process, what we can rely upon,
            is inevitable change. Over time, there is an opportunity to heal and give thanks for the precious gifts received
            by stretching past our sadness or disappointments, hopefully to finally understand that our love has no limits.
            Every life is meaningful, no matter how long or brief</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Our emotional connection to others can cause a myriad of experiences from joy and ecstasy all the way to anger, sadness,
            and despair. Yet, there is always the gift or the possibility to realize our own capacity to love more.</p>

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">I’M GOING TO MISS YOU. <br> LET’S JUST KISS AND SAY GOODBYE …</h4>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My mother used to say, “Getting old is not for Sissies.” Over time, I have arrived at my own definition of that family
            adage. What can be so challenging for many of us is when the people we have known for years, (and consider to
            be part of our true “inner circle” … those long-term friends or loved</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">ones who have been there for us; who really know us; who’ve shared in our life’s journey; have held us closely when
            we have gone through the thick and the thin, or endured both the sorrowful and joyful times … those true-blue
            angels who have always just “been there”)… sadly, may leave us. Perhaps some will leave without ever truly knowing
            how deeply we really did love them.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Yes, although our closest family members or cherished friends remain constant, (and they are the people we can always
            call upon no matter the physical distance or the time in-between), eventually, if we live to know it, at one
            point, they will also be counted amongst <i>the dearly
                departed.</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With that notion, I am urged to share a touching story whereby a lovely woman, Connie, asked me to help her finally
            share her absolute love for her sister, Rosie, who was terminally ill. Connie and Rosie grew up in a large family
            of no fewer than a dozen children. Connie was one of the younger children. Rosie was ranked amongst her older
            siblings and in fact, according to Connie, Rosie was more like a “second mother” to her than a sister. Although
            Connie described her family roots as staunchly Christian; serious by nature, (even pretty stern at times), what
            she recalls as being the most remarkable trait was that they never ever shared the words,
        </p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">479 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-10"> “I love you” with one another.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With a lingering sadness, Connie contacted me with her <i>Inspired
                Heart Letter</i> request. Her dear sister, Rosie, who lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, had been diagnosed with
            an advanced stage of cancer. Connie was beside herself with emotional angst and feeling quite distraught over
            Rosie’s pending demise. Connie described Rosie as being the most “light-hearted” family member. While growing
            up, the rest of Connie’s family appeared to her as repressed, controlled, and, well, “good people, just not very
            fun.” But Rosie possessed a wonderful laugh and was, in comparison, a bright, joyful star amongst the rest of
            the more stoic, bland family members.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When she called me, Connie had already made a plane reservation to visit Rosie. Not only did she need to see her,
            (perhaps for the last time), but she truly wished to express her love for her big sister. In Connie’s words,
            “I can’t bear to let Rosie pass from this earth not knowing how much I love her. But every time I try to tell
            her, my stomach turns into a complete knot, sometimes it’s even hard to catch my breath, and I just can’t do
            it.” Connie further explained her agonizing frustration, resulting in many sleepless nights wishing she could
            be brave enough, and honestly share with Rosie all the bottled-up love she always held for her dear sister.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Just listening to Connie speak, I received a clear picture</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">of her sister, Rosie. I saw that she did enjoy a good joke, loved to have family and friends around, and was actually
            quite a charmingly feminine “girly-girl”. Connie agreed with me wholeheartedly and went on to say how much Rosie
            had always loved shopping for cute clothes and had quite the closet full to prove it; that she always had her
            beautiful hair done; loved her favorite perfume, grew her own flowers, always wore makeup, and had the best manicures.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With that, I suggested Connie consider planning a special “sisters’ day” along with her visit. I thought perhaps
            having a manicurist come to Rosie’s home as well as a foot reflexologist and/or massage therapist; either way,
            plan a relaxing day with as much pampering as could be tolerated. Connie seemed to brighten at the thought of
            just “chilling out” with her big sis and enjoying their time together. I also suggested Connie purchase a blank
            card whereby, the <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> could be enclosed. Connie let me know that she had already found
            the perfect card and it was adorned with a sparkling silver rose on the cover. In order to make things even easier,
            I gave Connie a few verbal opening lines she could say just prior to giving her sister the card:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">“Rosie, I have prayed for you. I am so sorry you have to deal with all this. Maybe it was the way we were raised,
            but</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">sometimes it’s hard for me to openly say what I really want to… and find the right words in a conversation. So I
            thought it might be more clear for you if I wrote down my thoughts. Here it is.”</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Connie wiped her tears for both the anticipation and sense of relief she simultaneously experienced. She was so thankful.
            Here is Connie’s long-awaited letter to Rosie …</p>

            <p class="mb-10"><i>While I have always been one of the “little sisters” in our big family,
                    I pretty much always thought of you as being sort of like a second

                    us. But you were also the one who was always so light-hearted and
    
                    fun! They say that one of the biggest regrets in life is when you fail

                    when I was in the eighth grade. It was a pretty awkward stage for
                    me. I recall how I hated the way I looked and considered myself to
                    be pretty “homely”. I usually only wore plaid shirts and blue jeans…
                    and those glasses! Ugh. Well, Rosie, I do remember that once you

            stepfather, Jerry, had suddenly passed away from an unexpected massive coronary. The shocking news was overwhelming.
            The grieving couple was in the process of making harried plans to travel out of state for the family gathering
            and funeral. Janet’s husband, Kyle , was having a difficult time dealing with the news and emotionally pulling
            it together.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Janet called me, she sounded very distraught, to say the least. Kyle was relying on her to write a eulogy for
            his stepfather, as he was too stricken with emotion to even clear his thoughts. Janet mentioned just how urgent,
            if not unreasonable, this eulogy request was, as they were leaving for the airport soon, and she actually needed
            to have the eulogy packed and ready to go in a mere fifteen minutes!</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I grabbed my notebook and asked her to take a couple deep breaths. Then, I asked her to recall anything at all

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">regarding the history and nature of her husband’s stepfather. I asked if there were any constant references or things
            that highlighted Jerry as a person and as a father figure. In other words, what did her husband share most often
            about his relationship with his stepdad?</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Janet quickly explained that, although Jerry was not blood related, Kyle adored him and considered him to be his
            actual father. Jerry had become Kyle’s stepfather when he was only three and his sister was only two. Their natural
            father had passed away and there was no recollection of him. Jerry was a retired military man. He enjoyed country
            western music. He was warm, kind, loving, and cherished his stepchildren; and he always wore cowboy boots.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The urgent demand for this <i>Inspired Heart Eulogy</i> required little thought and much intuition. I interviewed
            Janet for a mere five minutes, jotted down some notes, and began to write this important family eulogy. I was
            able to deliver Jerry’s eulogy that would be given by his son ten minutes later:</p>

            I had sent. For starters, her husband read the eulogy and instantly wept. While drying his tears, he exclaimed
            to his wife,
            <i>“How did you know Jerry sang along to
                Johnny Cash in the shower? I know I never shared that with you, and yet,
                just reading that brought back so many wonderful memories of growing up.”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When I wrote Jerry’s eulogy, I was inexplicably compelled to write down the part about singing to Johnny Cash’s music.

            his life. Again, it is truly my privilege to be a part of these enlightened writings that help to express and

            or accepting, that they have transitioned and their physical presence is transformed, that is difficult.</p>

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“I STILL MISS YOU, BOB”</h4>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Speaking from personal experience, my older brother, Bob, passed away from a long-term illness when he was only thirty-six.
            During the final three years of his life, I spent a great deal of time caring for and comforting him. My boyfriend
            at the time invited me to go on a very special vacation over the Christmas holiday, an African photo safari.
            I knew my brother’s health was declining rapidly. I pondered for weeks over whether I should go so far away at
            this critical time. I decided to ask my brother for his permission. Without the least bit of hesitation, my brother
            adamantly remarked, <i>“Life is for the living. You absolutely must
                go on this trip.”</i> So, I did.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The safari was quite amazing, to say the least. In fact, my boyfriend proposed in the most romantic way shortly after
            a hot air balloon ride over the Serengeti. I could not have been</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10"> happier. However, one day, while on this extravagant vacation safari, my new fiancé looked at me and exclaimed, <i>“What is the matter? You seem quite different; there is
                something going on with you.”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I turned to him and quietly said, <i>“I believe my brother just
                passed.”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When we returned home, I learned that my brother, Bobby, had indeed passed away. Actually, he transitioned at the
            same time I had felt his departure on an energetic level. I am told the funeral was spectacular. The procession
            of cars leading to the church was no less than a mile and a half long. Friends and family gathered in a profound,
            memorable way</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I was sad to have missed his funeral, the illustrious tribute in celebration of his life. However, I also knew the
            importance of my personal contribution, the love and caring, the time spent with my brother, including all the
            laughter and tears that could never be reclaimed by anyone who had not really been there with him through the
            ordeal of his final life chapter.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The lesson is found in the quality of time we spend with those we love while they are still alive. Life we share
            with others is quite precious. Our connections with others may be long-term, or fleeting, if not fragile. Acknowledging
            the</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-20">value of our relationships, appreciating the time we have to spend with one another, is important. We cannot take
            life for granted. Appreciating those we care for, spending time with those we love, and taking the time to honestly
            confront and clear up emotionally charged issues, is time well spent, not only for those we feel challenged by,
            but for those we may be worried about, and, most importantly, for our own sense of inner peace.</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I wrote a eulogy for a woman, Sally, whose elderly mother had passed away. This client was the eldest of three children.
            Her father had passed away several years prior.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Unfortunately, apart from more recent years, Sally had not spent much time with her mother. As it was initially shared
            with me, their relationship was rather damaged and disconnected as far back as Sally could recall. In particular,
            Sally felt as though she was the “black sheep” while growing up in her family</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">She often felt a keen sense of rejection, emotional neglect, even disdain from her mother. By continually giving
            her personal power and sense of self-worth away, Sally dealt with a great deal of internal anguish and depression

        <p class="mb-10">most of her lifetime. Therefore, most likely stemming from this deep sense of disapproval from her mother, she had
            difficulty building and maintaining worthwhile relationships with others. In fact, Sally struggled for years
            to enjoy a loving, healthy relationship with herself as well.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When she contacted me to help her write a meaningful eulogy, we had to process a great deal of her painful childhood
            memories and conflicts regarding feeling lovable, accepted, or worthy of receiving love from anyone. I felt such
            compassion for Sally who had forsaken her sense of belonging and had given her power away for most of her lifetime.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I understood Sally’s long-term struggle with self-acceptance and her profound sense of rejection, especially since
            she had finally started to move past the pain and was in the process of healing her relationship with her mom.
            Unfortunately, time had run out before Sally could finally communicate her feelings and openly resolve her long-term
            emotional issues with her mother. Now she was forced to deal with her mother’s passing.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Honestly, we spent a great deal of time reminiscing about Sally’s childhood and life. Intuitively, it seemed important
            for her to finally lay to rest her grievances and to acknowledge the gift offered in this moment, which was to</p>

        <p class="mb-10"> same manner. Some people can easily emote and tears flow like the river, while other people may hide out, not wanting
            to draw attention to their emotional distress. And others are somehow able to remain very stoic, if not seemingly
            detached, from the sadness of losing their loved one. I can recall when I was only about five years of age, my
            dear grandmother, “Grandma Lovey” (short for Lovinia), passed. I can still remember her singing, playing piano,
            baking pies, and driving her old Hudson Hornet car. I recall arguing with my cousins about just how old she was…
            as we thought surely she had to be well over one hundred years of age! Nevertheless, since she had raised several
            children and had many grand-children and other extended family, her funeral was very well attended.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My dad was the eldest of her five children. He had identical twin brothers, my uncles, who were affectionately referred
            to as “Uncle Pinky and Uncle Bluey.” Well, these two uncles, much to everyone’s surprise and my father’s chagrin,
            began hysterically laughing at their mother’s funeral. They were both hunched over in complete belly rolls of
            laughter. It was not for years later that I learned that laughter is often just a stress relief. And for some
            people, who cannot succumb to tears… well, they laugh.</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This brings me to another <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> that I wrote for Gail, a young woman whose husband’s father
            recently passed away. Gail’s husband, Matthew, was a caring man who worked as a paramedic. At his father’s funeral,
            reportedly Gail not only acted rudely and aloof toward his family members, but belittled her husband in front
            of them. It was no surprise that after his father’s funeral service and family wake ended, Matthew became distraught
            with anger at his wife. In fact, he made her sleep on the couch!</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Gail realized her behavior was not only inappropriate, but cruel. She expressed to me how funerals seem to trigger
            the worst in her since she had lost her father at a very young age. Truly, she felt remorseful. She asked for
            my help. Here is her apology.</p>

            letter and between the lines, Mathew knew his wife’s behavior was certainly out of character, and he soon realized
            how traumatized she had been over her own father’s demise. She was such a little girl when her father passed,
            and Gail had never really processed the emotional shock that she felt. Needless to say, Matthew did forgive her
            with true compassion for her loss. Gail felt so relieved by her husband’s response, she was able to forgive herself

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">On another occasion, I was asked to write a eulogy for a woman who had absolutely no family members left to mourn
            her, or say goodbye. Hanna was a refugee from Hungary who married, was widowed, and never had children. She had
            lived a life of tribulation as a post-traumatic victim who had witnessed many horrors and atrocities during World
            War Two and during the Hungarian Revolution. Her life was largely one of hardship, deprivation, and, often, a
            sense of anguishing despair.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Despite her tortured past, Hanna was a sensible, somewhat stern, yet a good-hearted, religious woman, who enjoyed
            helping others in need. She found contentment within devoted friendships that, more often, felt like family.
            One of her dearest friends happened to be her family physician, a man about thirty years her junior. Her connection
            to him grew so deep over the years that she considered him in the same way a mother would care for a grown son.
            In fact, her loyal doctor/friend appreciated her endearing motherly kindness so much that he introduced her to
            his parents and siblings.</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">He actually flew her across country to attend his family’s gatherings, as well as included her in most of his significant
            local family celebrations. Furthermore, he continued to oversee her healthcare well past his time working as
            a physician. They enjoyed a wonderful familylike, if not karmic, connection. This is an excerpt from Hanna’s
            eulogy I was inspired to write.</p>

            <p class="mb-10"><i>Yet we could never hold onto him for long. He would usually arrive
                    unexpectedly, always bringing wonderful gifts and never expecting
                    anything in return. As a little girl, I remember Richard sitting me
                    down next to him while he magically played the piano and sang
                    songs such as “You’ve really got a hold on me.” Then, poof! He would
                    hop in his car and ride off into the sunset with his pet dog, free as a
                    bird, and I would instantly miss him.</i></p>

                    results from a medical procedure to his brain that went awry. After
                    that, he would never physically leave us again… not until now. He
                    was such an endearing soul and, once again, a truly precious gift to

                    expectations, to be more caring, more generous, and to be kind. My
                    family has grieved for Richard over the decades, since his health
                    challenge left him with no other choice but to be on the receiving end
                    of our care. Our beautiful mother never left his side.</i></p>

                    their own, we send our never-ending stream of joyful tears, knowing

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When those we love move on in death, it causes a way to consider and reflect upon their life, almost as if we are
            reading a novel or watching a movie and they are the star or main feature. In other words, our lives seem to
            move and transform as though in chapters or scenes. There is a beginning, middle, and the final curtain, when
            our loved one has completed their story or life purpose and moves on. It is an opportunity to deeply ponder what
            their lessons and contributions may have been in this lifetime. We can also consider our connection to them.
            Hopefully, we can find a sense of peace surrounded in gratitude for the opportunity and experience of knowing
            them.</p>

        <p class="mb-10"> memories, that were never consciously resolved, look to that pain and see the lessons learned or the gifts received.
            Or, begin to find a way to be at peace in spite of the painful relationship. The meaning their life held for
            them is their soul’s sojourn, their story or life plan.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Considering how the connection with the deceased creates a meaningful experience in the lives of those left behind,
            or how they may have contributed to your life path, is a beautiful way to locate a better sense of acceptance.
            Rest assured that we can change the outcome of any story simply by what we focus upon or give meaning to. Yes,
            indeed <i>Life
                is for the living</i>. Therefore, be happy. Be satisfied. Choose a brighter path and enjoy your life <i>on purpose!</i></p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">What else can be said, except to revel in the joy that life offers? Make our lives as meaningful as we dare, and
            let go of any fear, shame, or guilt that prevents our divinity from shining brightly. Yes, understanding and
            claiming ourselves in the light of God, as being truly Divine, is an underestimated gift: an honoring, a tribute,
            and homage to our contribution as part of our own Divinely spiritual evolution.</p>
