		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-40">ESTRANGEMENT ISSUES – FAMILY FALL-OUTS <br> LOST CHILDREN: FROM ESTRANGEMENT TO RECONNECTING</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It never ceases to amaze me just how many sad and terrible stories
			of parent-child estrangement I have encountered. In fact, lately, the
			majority of <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>  requests I receive involve this very topic,
			ranging from a six-month time-out, to rather shocking separations
			involving grown children who have not connected with their mother or
			father for over twenty or thirty years. Despite these difficult</p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">rifts and
			lengthy separations, it is quite satisfying to see how parents and their
			sons or daughters can start to salvage their relationships and begin to
			reconnect through the written word. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Whether there has been a short or longer-term disconnect, it is
			quite possible to eventually heal from the painful emotional wounds,
			terrible disappointments, and, so often, simple misunderstandings that
			have destroyed the precious family bond. 
			</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The parent-child relationship is a primary connection that becomes
			a devastating and tragic loss when there is a falling out or the bond is
			broken. In certain instances, the emotional and/or physical connection
			was never formed, or at least not in a healthy way. Often, there is a transgenerational pattern, or a history of poor or even harmful parent-child
			connections, within the family lineage. Still, regardless of how obvious or
			hidden, in every child there is a deep yearning to feel loved and nurtured,
			and this experience becomes an integral part of their identity. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Children, who have experienced unhealthy connections with their
			parent(s) growing up, often subconsciously seek adult partners who
			manifest some or many of the same personality traits or behaviors similar
			to the dysfunctional</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">313 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">parent. This may be since unwholesome connections
			seem familiar or expected and because there is an underlying yearning
			to strive for being loved or accepted by their partner who unconsciously
			represents the parent-figure for whom the sense of healthy bonding was
			never realized.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Certain <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i> have served to help the parent and/or their children to experience a sort of reality check and finally understand, not only how unhealthy their situation is, but how they individually
			continue to feed the long-standing, underlying emotional pain. This new
			understanding allows a shift toward a closer, more satisfying blending
			of hearts to occur.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Just like most long-term relationships of any nature, including
			between parents and their offspring, how we each relate to one another
			is shaped and molded over time. After a while, the pattern of relating
			eventually runs on autopilot. Without intension or consciously considering the role each of us takes on, there is a certain predictability that
			evolves, both in our communications and interactions with one another. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This may not necessarily be a negative experience. For instance, if
			the relationship is formulated with enough respect, appreciation, kindness,
			and consideration, then a fairly positive predictable parent-child dynamic
			takes root and</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 314</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">blossoms with an unshakable trust that encourages a more
			open, honest relationship. Conversely, when the dynamic is unhealthy
			and there is not a real sense of perceived safety in one or more areas, then
			obviously, a more difficult relationship is formed, often with a sense of
			antagonism or defensiveness </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When there is a falling out or a big enough disappointment and the
			notion of ever salvaging the relationship seems futile, even to the point
			where there is a final parting of the ways, consider that the identified
			problem is not the actual cause, rather it is a symptom. The very nature
			of the particular parent-child dynamic is at the root of the issue. Taking
			this a step further, typically there is never a conscious decision to create
			any type of unwholesome relationships with our kids. However, in the
			words of Thomas Moore, <i>“Wherever you go, you take yourself with you.” </i> Emotionally unhealthy parents, or parents who may be trapped with feelings of unworthiness, or those who have not experienced healthy relationships with their own parents, are more likely to feel inadequate
			when raising their own kids.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sometimes, a parent attempts to correct the flaws found in his or
			her own childhood by overcompensating in other ways, at times, to the
			extreme. For example, a parent who</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">315 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-20">was raised in a latchkey environment
			or with absentee parents, may be overly protective and smothering
			toward his or her kids. If a parent grew up in a home where there was never
			enough money and the family struggled, that parent might overindulge
			their children. When a parent is unable to devote enough time and
			energy toward nurturing the relationship with their kids, or if the parent,
			is uncomfortable expressing love in positive ways that are emotionally
			supportive, the relationship will not entirely thrive.</p>

		<h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10">Lowell’s Story</h3>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I once wrote an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> for Lowell, a man in his late fifties, who had grown up as an only child in the suburbs of New York
			City. His father passed away when he was nine years old. His mother was
			overwhelmed with grief and had never held a job before. Immediately,
			as a young boy, Lowell went to work selling papers, stocking shelves at
			a hardware store, and doing other odd jobs in order to support himself
			and his mother. While he often cried himself to sleep at night over the
			loss of his dad, he was devoted to his mother and determined to make
			sure they survived. </p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 316</p>
		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Eventually, Lowell grew up, went away to college, became a financial
			accountant, married a lovely woman, Judy, and enjoyed a very happy
			marriage. Together, they raised their two children, a girl and a boy. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Lowell was considered a very kind, caring, and generous person.
			Without fail, he volunteered at soup kitchens every Thanksgiving and
			donated his time and money to other charities as well. He was always
			ready to lend a helping hand to friends and neighbors, whether it was a
			financial loan, dog-sitting, or bringing chicken soup to a sick neighbor. Lowell raised his children, Debora and James, with an abundance of care.
			He gave them everything he could to make sure they were educated and
			had every opportunity to build successful lives. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">His daughter, Debora, had gone to college as an exchange student
			in Norway and happened to fall in love with a local Norwegian. She was
			happily married with two young children and living abroad. His son,
			James, who was in his mid-thirties, was climbing the corporate ladder
			and held an impressive position in the world of international finance. He
			had been living in Sweden over the last three years and during that time
			had not seen his parents.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">317 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Given these apparently successful outcomes, I was surprised when
			Lowell contacted me to write a letter to his son, James.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The previous summer, James had finally been able to take some
			time off and fly home to Southern California for a three-week visit with
			his folks. Prior to his arrival, he telephoned his father to inform him
			about his flight schedule. Instead of planning to meet James at the airport
			terminal, Lowell suggested to James that he should rent a car on his own,
			so he and his wife, (James’ mother), could avoid all the fuss of driving
			down to the airport and finding parking, especially since it was a holiday
			weekend and it would probably be a hassle. Somehow, James forgot his
			father’s request or did not hear that message in their phone conversation.
			At any rate, he telephoned his folks when he arrived, with the expectation
			that they were picking him up at the airport.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Lowell became somewhat perturbed and reminded James to rent a
			car as he had already asked him to do. James was apparently surprised his
			parents were not there to meet him, especially since he had taken time
			from his demanding job and flown all the way from Sweden just to spend
			time visiting with them. When James protested, letting his father know
			that he had not secured a rental car, and besides,</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 318</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">it was pretty difficult
			to acquire a car during a busy holiday weekend, Lowell became annoyed
			and snidely responded by saying, <i>“You are a grown man, James, I am
			sure you can figure something out.”</i> Well, James was so deeply offended
			by his father’s belligerence, he decided not to visit or contact either of
			his parents during his entire three-week vacation. Instead, he telephoned
			his maternal grandmother, who happened to be Lowell’s arch enemy…
			nemesis, and well, rather difficult mother in-law, and spent the entire
			three weeks with her.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">So, not only did James fail to contact his parents while he was
			spending time in Southern California, but choosing to spend his entire
			vacation with his grandmother was a real rub in Lowell’s face. Lowell
			considered “Grandma” to be a terrible, meddlesome, and conniving
			mother-in-law who never treated him or his wife with any measure of
			respect or common courtesy.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Over the next couple months, James never once attempted to
			make any contact with his parents. Lowell was completely undone with
			anger and upset by this. He felt so indignant and could not understand
			why James would decide to deny an opportunity to visit with his parents
			and followed by choosing to ignore them altogether. Lowell felt his son,
			James, was impudent and ungrateful. Lowell’s growing</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">319 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">sense of rejection
			was matched by his outrage. As this unsettling situation preyed heavily
			upon Lowell, he began losing sleep and feeling overly anxious and
			worried. Moreover, his mother-in-law seemed to taunt Lowell as she left
			several long-winded voicemail messages exclaiming about the wonderful
			time she had spent with James while he was in California.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Exasperated, Lowell called upon my letter-writing service. He was
			quite distraught over the situation. He knew he needed to clear the air
			with his son. However, it seemed that Lowell’s idea of putting an end
			to this nonsense was to send his son a very powerful message, a letter
			that would cause James to feel complete shame and guilt regarding the
			awful way he was treating his parents. (By the way, although their son
			had no direct conversation with his mom, he knew that his parents
			always supported one another, and that his mother would never side
			with anyone but his dad.)</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">During my conversation with Lowell regarding the letter request,
			he barely spoke three sentences before I stopped him in his tracks. It
			was abundantly clear to me that the underlying dynamic, which caused
			this rift, was not about the rental car. Instead, I intuitively sensed the
			significant historical power struggle under way. I abruptly called Lowell’s</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 320</p>

		<p class="mb-10">
			attention to the fact that he and his wife should have made the effort to
be there at the airport. I could not understand why, after not seeing their
only son for three years, they were not there waiting at the gate armed
with a WELCOME HOME poster and balloons!</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Interestingly, the actual unhealthy dynamic suddenly revealed
			itself in a crystal-clear way. I proceeded to share more insights about how I felt Lowell was not allowing his son to really Man Up. In other words,
			he was not respecting his son as an adult, nor as a successful businessman. I picked up that Lowell was interfering in his son’s business affairs
			by offering unsolicited advice, (telling him what to do and how to invest
			his money); moreover, he was upset since his son was thirty-five and had
			not yet settled down and married. Lowell shared that he and his wife
			always put their kids first, often sacrificing their own needs financially in
			order that their children, no matter what age, would never go without. I
			also saw that James resented his father for treating him like he was still a
			kid, for not acknowledging his independence, or his success.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Gratefully, Lowell was open to this conversation. He paused for a
			few moments, and then exclaimed, <i>“No one has ever pointed this out to
			me. I grew up without a father. I missed not having my dad. I never wanted
			my children to feel abandoned like I did…”</i></p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">321 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Luckily, Lowell was open to analyzing and admitting how he had
			contributed to the strained relationship with his son. Furthermore,
			Lowell was willing and motivated to change his conversation, to re-examine
			how judgmental and pedantic he had been and to really see his son’s
			perspective. Once Lowell conceded to abide by certain boundaries, such
			as refraining from offering James further unsolicited financial advice, or
			meddling in his son’s personal life, I agreed to compose Lowell’s <i>Inspired
			Heart Letter.</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Looking at his son’s contribution to this falling out with his folks,
			perhaps James was unable to convey his apprehension or communicate
			openly with his father as well. Instead of sitting down with Dear Old
			Dad, and working through their aggravation, James seemed to be rather
			difficult or punitive by withholding his real feelings and choosing to
			ignore his parents. In a way, this seemed quite similar to his father’s
			communication challenge since his dad initially struggled to truly
			express himself. Hmmm, could this be a learned response?</p>

			Later that day, Phyllis, his wife called. She mentioned how perfect the

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Finally, they sent it to James. A whole week went by before Lowell

			hanging up the phone, he promptly drove to my office to share the good news in person. Lowell was filled with relief and appreciation for the dramatic shift in their connection</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">I helped Lowell to openly acknowledge his innermost feelings and

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">FOLLOWING THROUGH</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Parents are their children’s primary teachers and role models. By
			example, they teach their children how to communicate, or express their
			feelings and desires, in either healthy or not so healthy ways; how to
			show or withhold affection; how to problem solve, etc. Children grow
			up usually mimicking the “family style” for achieving a sense of power,
			safety, and for getting their needs met.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Parents who live with a sense of personal integrity or good character
			naturally impart those traits onto their kids. Being accountable and
			keeping your word are two of the most important merits you can embrace. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Some parents may fall short and not follow through with their
			word, creating a domino effect. Likewise, their kids</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 328</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">may not follow
			through with parent/teacher directives, house rules, or other responsibilities either. When we fail to keep our word, we get to experience a
			multitude of repercussions when everything seems to turn sideways or
			goes out of control.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Yes, parenting is hard work, and often, more than a bit overwhelming. It takes a great deal of fortitude, backbone, and a willingness
			to be a disciplinarian, even if it hurts you more than your child. By
			the time the child enters adolescence, if the expectations for good
			behavior are not well-established and adhered to, the road to compliance
			can be a treacherous climb.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">All kids try to push the boundaries set by parents and others in
			authority. That is normal. When children do locate the boundary,
			however unpleasant, they usually feel an inner, if not unconscious,
			sense of safety and relief. Parents, being the first and primary teachers
			to their child, teach their children directly by setting stated rules and
			consequences as well as indirectly through setting examples or modeling
			acceptable behaviors by their own actions.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ideally, the child grows up in a healthy, intact, two-parent household. Just as in the previous letter vignette, “Chip Off the Old Block”,
			although there were issues between Lowell and his son, James never once
			considered trying to</p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">convince his mother to take his side in their dispute.
			That is a sign of healthy parenting. Parents may certainly not agree all the
			time, or even half the time, but when they model themselves as a united
			front for their children, they hold a much stronger and effective position.</p>

		<h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">Sylvia’s Story</h3>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“ALL THAT GLITTERS”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This brings to mind the story of Sylvia, a mother who implored
			upon my letter-writing skills in order to set a healthy boundary with her
			daughter, Brittany. Actually, Sylvia</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">wished to teach Brittany the value of
			earning money and the responsibilities that go along with financial success.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In this case, Sylvia had married into an extremely wealthy family.
			She and her husband had raised their very beautiful, intelligent daughter,
			Brittany, amidst an ultra-luxurious lifestyle. Brittany had everything a girl
			born with a silver spoon could ever want. It seemed the word <i>“No”</i>  was
			not part of her vocabulary when it came to spending lavishly. Brittany was
			in her late twenties, unmarried, but with a steady beau, well-educated,
			and residing in a beautiful penthouse apartment in San Francisco’s very
			upscale, tony neighborhood, known as Pacific Heights.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Brittany possessed a rich, innovative imagination. To her credit,
			she had real aspirations for creating new, interesting entrepreneurial
			projects that, at first glance, appeared as promising ideas. However, time and time again, after sinking a ton of money into them, every business
			plan failed before they barely got off the ground. You see, Brittany,
			considered her ideas only at face value and failed to do the proper
			marketing analysis and research to confirm the actual feasibility of the
			proposed business ventures. Somehow, despite these very costly, now
			buried business ideas, Brittany forged on in her attempt to finally see one
			of her ideas through to its success.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">331 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Meanwhile, Brittany never felt the pain of an actual real-world
			financial loss, since her parents and grandparents continued to indulge
			her and front the money for every novel business whim. While Brittany
			was not earning any of her own money, she was supported by a handsome trust fund that paid around $30,000.00 per month. Further, her parents paid for her luxurious apartment in the city.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This scenario played out over and over before her mother began
			feeling overwhelmed and quite concerned that Brittany was taking
			advantage of her family’s financial power with little regard for the value
			of a well-earned dollar. However, Brittany’s father was apparently not
			too concerned with his daughter’s irresponsible spending habits and
			flippant business skills. As a result, there was growing tension between
			her parents. Moreover, Brittany’s grandparents could not seem to say <i>“No,” </i> either, and continued to generously spend heaps of money on financing
			their granddaughter’s whimsical business ideas. Her mother was in a
			real pickle and knew that ultimately, by setting a limit and maintaining
			financial restraints on their daughter’s behalf, either her husband or
			in-laws would somehow eventually override her efforts.</p>

			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 332</p>
		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At the time Sylvia contacted me, she had finally managed to
			convince her husband to withhold Brittany’s hefty allowance while
			still paying for her apartment and living expenses. Along with cutting
			their daughter off from her allowance, Brittany, in turn, (with apparent
			contempt), cut herself off from having any contact with her parents. This
			manipulative maneuver did create quite a bit of family tension. Once
			her parents agreed to significantly cut her off from their financial purse
			strings, they had not seen or spoken to Brittany in over six months.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sylvia was heartbroken and, at the same time, felt that she was
				fighting a losing battle, although she understood that her daughter
				would deeply benefit from gaining the real-life experience of responsibly
				earning her way instead of being handed everything on a silver platter.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sylvia requested an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> in order to promote
			Brittany’s sense of awareness and maturity. This particular letter request
			was somewhat challenging, since there was such little support from
			Brittany’s father and the rest of the family. Sylvia, in essence, was finally
			taking a stand for her daughter’s sense of value, purpose, and relationship toward money. Unfortunately, Sylvia was standing alone.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While I applauded Sylvia’s sensibility and desire to teach her
			daughter a valuable life lesson, I cautioned her, on a practical note, given
			the circumstance; there was a chance that Brittany might not actually be
			receptive or acknowledge the real message delivered within the <i>Inspired
			Heart </i>, immediately. Realistically, it may take time, perhaps not for
			years to come.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">On another occasion, I was invited to write an <i>Inspired Heart
			Letter</i> for another mother, Tanya, who had not had contact with her three
			sons in at least sixteen years. I am uncertain what exactly caused Tanya
			to leave her marriage and abandon her young children even years earlier.
			Based upon our telephone interview, it was evident that this unfortunate
			woman had never healed from a great deal of physical and emotional
			trauma surrounding her childhood, including paternal incest. What was
			even more disturbing was the emotional distance and sense of rejection
			she still felt from her own mother.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Tanya initially took off, leaving her husband and kids

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At one point, after several years of living a lonely existence filled
			with guilt over her separation from her three sons, one son, Randy,
			somehow was able to invite her to his wedding. This poor lady managed
			to bungle that opportunity when, at the wedding, her youngest son, Eric,
			invited her to dance. Unfortunately, instead of relishing in this gentle
			overture, while they were dancing together, Tanya blurted an insult.
			She laughingly accused Eric of having two left feet. After hearing this
			disparaging remark, Eric quickly left the dance floor and never spoke to
			her again.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With great shame and embarrassment, Tanya flew home shortly

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Our connections to others, and especially with our children, are precious. If not continually nurtured, the trust begins to lessen and the bond becomes fragile. Treating our children with respect only serves to strengthen their own self-respect.

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Interestingly, it took Max over a year, (and after many inquiries),

			unrealized fear that perhaps felt more powerful than risking possible
			further rejection by attempting to reconnect with his daughter. Obviously Max was plagued by his disconnected relationship with Bette or he
			would not have hounded me for so long, while going back and forth over
			the notion of sending her an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>.
			. Emotional paralysis is not without consequences, and in his case, perhaps his unwillingness to put the energy toward plugging the holes in the boat could easily have sunken any chances of keeping his relationship with his daughter afloat.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">RESISTANCE</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">How sad it would be if we never felt the love that is available. While it is true, we cannot roll back the clock, I believe we can embrace the
			precious time we do have to move forward hand in hand. When there is
			a rift or falling out with a family member or loved one, it is important to
			be willing to meet the other person halfway, or more.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Searching for the truth, even when we run the risk of rejection,
			is a powerful way to claim our freedom. With that understanding, it is
			important and wise to ask the other person to inform you on just what
			else you can do, or otherwise, how can you best help to resolve and
			heal your relationship matter. Finally, letting the other person know
			you would really love to hear back from them is a powerful gesture that
			creates an opening to possibly rekindle or repair the relationship and
			invites the other person to share their thoughts or feelings as well.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Regarding his “The Long and Winding Road” message, Max waffled
			for well over a year, before committing to the letter. In my interview with
			him, he seemed somewhat unwilling to take ownership or even show
			sufficient compassion for his</p>

		<p class="mb-10">daughter’s point of view, or for her experience
			of their relationship. Rather, it seemed that Max actually felt victimized,
			blaming his inadequacy on his history of depression. I could empathize
			with his daughter’s position for essentially walking away from a father
			who was so shut-down emotionally</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Unfortunately, we remain stuck in the outer manifestation of our
			predicament, such as a loss of connection with a loved one, when we are
			unwilling to be vulnerable and expose ourselves to the truth. We can
			choose to open our eyes and our heart and certainly learn from the past.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Feelings such as guilt, shame, or resentment can stunt our potential
			for happiness. Turning those annoying feelings into opportunities to grow
			and to bravely strive for an emotional cleansing is to claim emotional freedom. Unearthing the motives behind our own resistance is essential
			if we are to find peace with ourselves and others. We can be poor editors
			of our own feelings. A successful letter is not about a cover-up, but
			about vulnerability and exposure. Max vacillated because he may have
			felt more comfortable being depressed and sitting on his underlying
			anger, as outward expressions of anger or emotional pain is often taboo
			in our culture.

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“CHASING AFTER YESTERDAY”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Another difficult letter request came from a woman, Jody, who was
			the sister of Gary, a man who was living on a farm in Iowa. Gary and
			Jody came from a large family of fifteen, (yes, this is not a typo), fifteen
			children. They were raised by staunchly religious Catholic parents. Gary
			was one of the older children. He was in his late sixties, never married,
			and living on farmland he inherited from his folks. When he was a young
			man, he had spent about a year in a Catholic seminary. Afterwards, he
			was eventually drafted and spent time as a combat Marine in Vietnam
			during the war.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Gary returned home from the war, he was obviously
			distressed. According to his sister, he not only was shocked by the war
			experience alone, but at times had felt unappreciated if not mistreated
			by his fellow countrymen. It seems Gary started drinking alcohol more
			often and otherwise usually kept to himself. At one point, he met a young
			lady, Nora, and they started dating. When Nora discovered she was
			pregnant, Gary offered to marry her, but she refused his proposal.

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Gary did financially support his baby daughter, April, and visited
			with her during her early and formative childhood years until Nora
			finally met another man and got married. According to Gary, Nora felt it
			was best that he move on and allow his daughter to enjoy a whole family
			without confusing her with two father figures. So Gary did just that. He
			moved to live on his parent’s farm and eventually, after they passed, he
			remained their alone. Gary continued to be a devout Catholic and was
			known for being charitable toward others less fortunate in the community. However, he never saw his daughter, April, again. Now, thirty years later, Gary was suffering from liver disease. Further, his neurological functions were starting to decline.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With Gary’s expressed permission, his sister, Jody, contacted me to write an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> from Gary to his long-lost daughter, April.
			He knew that with his declining health, he had just a brief window of
			time to share a revealing message that might alleviate the emotional pain
			he most likely caused by extricating himself from his daughter’s life when
			she was not quite twelve years of age. In composing this letter, it was
			my sincere hope that Gary could finally tear off some of the armor
			surrounding his heart and find a sense of vulnerability, kindness, and a
			measure of relief.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Gary’s sister, Jody, collected the letter from me; as she read it, she cried. She explained that Gary had become increasingly reclusive over

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">From time to time, I receive letter requests from adult children
			who are estranged or feel disengaged from a parent and wish to come to
			terms and heal their relationship issue. It is an interesting dynamic, since
			often there is a lack of what is called “individuation” whereby the grown
			child still considers their parent to be in an exalted position or have
			authority over them. It takes time for people to finally come to terms
			with the notion that their parents are only mere mortals and not only
			imperfect, but no more powerful, or necessarily more knowing or right
			than their offspring.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Often when there is a serious rift between a parent and child,
			the child carries a deep imprint that may hold a belief, such as <i>“I am
			not lovable… I am not enough… or I am the problem,”</i>  etc. It is a healthy
			realization to come to terms with a parent being human and subject to
			human frailties.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Hopefully over time, with wisdom gained and maturity, the previously
			angry or turned-off child can learn to accept their parents as imperfect,
			or unenlightened.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">OTHER FALL-OUTS WITH FRIENDS & FAMILY</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Often, there are long-standing issues and separations between parents
			and their grown children, grown siblings, or long-term friendships that
			stem from an earlier experience that led to feelings of guilt, resentment, or
			betrayal. In my letter-writing experience, often the outward manifestation
			has to do with MONEY issues. Common themes are often around one
			sibling taking financial advantage, committing fraud, and/or absconding
			with the elderly parents’ money, cheating the parents out of their income
			or their sibling(s) out of their legal inheritance, or failing to repay or honor
			loans from family members or friends.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Frequently the victims feel it is not worth the time, effort, or legal expenses to resolve this in court, or it would be too stressful for the

		<p class="mb-10">another way to escape from having to pay.
			In sum, perhaps one way or another, it is just too painful to deal with. So
			more often nothing is done and the financial perpetrator gets away with
			his or her evil deeds.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At times, adults who did not grow up in a healthy family environment may feel an acute sense of entitlement and may blame their parents
			for not being good parents and/or not giving them enough. Taking it a
			step further, they may blame their parents for their own inadequacies,or failures in life. In this case, a certain neurosis sets in and a false sense of
			entitlement allows the grown child to remain shortsighted, narcissistic,
			or self-centered.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The perpetrators obviously have real character flaws. Instead of
			taking the defensive position when confronted with their selfish, conniving
			acts, they tend to take the more powerful offensive position and may try to
			use guilt or shame toward someone else in order to justify their misdeeds
			and get away with their betrayal. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I was once asked to write a letter from a man, Ralph, to his older

			rest of the family. This man grew up with a physical disability; he was
			blind since birth. A great deal of their parent’s attention was paid to him.
			As a result, his sister, Carol, in comparison, felt somewhat neglected.
			Moreover, growing up, she was expected to always be there to help her
			brother. It seemed there was an obvious resentment toward her disabled

			during her childhood.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Carol, a devout Christian, was married, and a mother of three

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Feeling betrayed by Carol was one thing, but to be ridiculed and
			rejected by others in the family was difficult to bear. Ralph’s sister did ake the offensive and somehow disparaged her brother to her children and other relatives. She was rude, belittling, and complained about
			her needy brother to others. By keeping him away, she made sure he
			felt unwelcome. By somehow making her brother “wrong,” Carol could
			protect herself from having to face the truth, that she violated her
			mother’s trust and cheated Ralph out of his inheritance.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Carol was only deluding herself, though. There was a hefty price
			to pay for her selfish ways and financial/emotional abuse. As time wore
			on, she became increasingly bitter and angry toward Ralph. This seemed
			to consume her energy and overshadowed her enjoyment of life, which
			led to more difficulty connecting with her own children and other family
			members. She was primarily fueled by anger and a need to justify her
			words and actions. While her inheritance allowed Carol to be more
			comfortable on a material level, she felt emotionally bankrupt; this led to
			her dissatisfied and miserable life.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Just when you think you’ve heard it all, life’s stories continue to
			surprise us. One day, I happened to meet a businessman from the East
			Coast while having dinner in a trendy local restaurant. Christopher
			eventually opened up and shared about his awkward circumstance
			surrounding his family of origin and the strange <i>skeleton in the closet</i> or difficult family matter that had caused his own mother to refuse to communicate with him in any way for nearly a year. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Well, this provocative conversation certainly captured my attention.
			I was <i>all ears</i> as Christopher revealed the
			weird

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 372</p>
		</div>

		<p class="mb-10">story which had served
			to reopen an old wound from his childhood and adolescence. Chris
			was nearly fifty years of age. He had been divorced twice and had two
			young adult daughters who were both upwardly mobile, and educated
			professionals. Moreover, one daughter just recently became engaged, and
			Christopher was hopeful that his future son-in-law would prove to be an
			honorable guy. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Okay, so back to the mysterious family secret; Chris explained
			to me that he and his younger brother, Billy, had gone on a fishing trip
			the summer before last. As they were baiting their hooks, Billy casually
			commented, “It was sure a shame that Frankie passed away” … (Frankie
			was an old family friend the brothers knew since they were small).Christopher agreed, it was a shame that Frankie had passed on. However, Billy, then made a most interesting remark: “You know, Chris,
			I was mentioned in Frankie’s obituary … I was named as his son.” Chris
			retorted, “What the… huh?” Billy continued to say that after he learned
			of this shocking news, he followed up with their mother. Their mom
			verified it. Yes. Frankie was actually Billy’s “real” father. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This news struck a chord with Christopher since his relationship
			with his father had always been pretty awful. His father was a terrible,
			raging alcoholic. Although, he and their mom raised five children,
			whenever the father got drunk, </p>

		<p class="mb-10">he would physically take it out on
			Christopher, who happened to be the eldest of the five kids. This went
			on for years until their mother finally got up the courage to divorce their
			difficult dad when Chris was about sixteen. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After that fishing trip, Christopher, arrived home, hell-bent on
			getting to the bottom of this. Much to his amazement, there was more
			shocking news! It turned out that out of the five children, there were
			three separate biological “baby-daddys” of which none were included
			as the man they knew as their father, Ron, who helped to raise them.
			Christopher discovered that Uncle Timmy, his mother’s sister’s husband,
			who had died several years back was his biological father. Given his
			brutal history with his Dad, Chris tried to call upon his mother for the
			truth. Unfortunately, apparently out of a deep sense of shame, his mother
			went into hiding. She refused to respond in any way to Chris despite
			his numerous attempts to contact her. Although she lived about twenty
			minutes away, she would not answer her door, nor would she pick up her
			phone, or respond to his voicemails or text messages. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It was as though fate had lent a hand when I happened to meet this
			man. I agreed to help Chris clear the slate and ghost-write an <i>Inspired
