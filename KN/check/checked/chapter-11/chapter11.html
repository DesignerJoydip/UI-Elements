            ability, but with her words on paper. She is mighty with the pen. Not only
            does Kristine write letters from the heart that help people reconnect with
            each other on a level that transcends the ego and having to be right, but she has an uncanny ability to get to the essence of what really needs attention
            in a relationship. Whether the disconnect has occurred between a man and
            woman, a mother and daughter, or father and son… the relationship does
            not seem to matter. As Kris taps into our real connection, she is then able to
            put pen to paper and put into words a heartfelt communication that both
            can feel, and their sense of the trueness of their relationship comes into their

            could have been. I was repeating the only thing I knew: an icy standoff with
            the very people I loved. So, before Kristine’s help, my three grown sons were
            barely speaking to me, and my mom and I had difficulty being in the same
            room together.</i></p>
        <p class="mb-10"><i>After years of therapy and rebuilding my life, I wanted some way to reach
            out to let them know how much having a connection with them would
            mean to me. So she wrote my sons loving, heartfelt letters expressing the
            genuine love and heartache I felt. She wrote a beautiful eulogy I read at my
            mom’s funeral that came straight from my own heart, using my thoughts
            written by Kristine. She has a gift and skill to express exactly how I feel on
            paper. My sons have started to warm up to me and though my mom isn’t in
            physical form, I feel her loving presence every day.”
