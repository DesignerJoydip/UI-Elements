		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-30">GUIDANCE FOR WRITING YOUR POWERFUL HEALING LETTER</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">For those interested in writing their own letters, I have some sage advice. First, when I have attempted to write a letter
			to a significant other on my own behalf, it is usually more than a bit challenging. One of the main reasons I can write
			compelling messages for clients is that I do not possess the egos of those clients. I do not have their emotional triggers
			or whatever their personal and relationship history brings to the mix that often obstructs clear, impressive, positive
			communication. Therefore, it is imperative to exorcise or let go of any emotional wound that binds you.</p>

		</div>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">GETTING OUT OF YOUR OWN WAY</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Just as Alice in Wonderland peered through the looking glass, (only to see how quite surprisingly different everything
			seemed)… do we ever really see our true self? Is our life story or current circumstance accurate? Or, do we ultimately
			choose how we experience life and our relationship with others based upon what we have agreed is true?</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is important to look at the situation you are concerned about through a very broad lens. It might require a sufficient
			time-out from any emotional reactivity or your own power struggle. A common desire is to want the last word or to dominate
			the issue from a one-sided, self-centered perspective. When you are undergoing emotional stress, it can be difficult to
			discern what is real, or see the whole picture. More importantly, to know what you do and do not have influence over for
			changing the circumstance at hand is a key component for communicating effectively</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Under certain circumstances, the “die has been cast,” and there is no hope for change. There is nothing more you can do.
			Accepting what is, or has happened, as being beyond your control is the first step toward developing a sense of calm.
			Hopefully, this is eventually followed by forgiveness and release.</p>

		</div>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10"><i>Let’s Get Started!</i></h4>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">PERSPECTIVE</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Begin your journey for writing your amazing letter by clearing your mind from all the emotional clutter and allow your
			heart to open. As you go within and connect more deeply with your true nature, you may see your situation somewhat differently
			and perhaps come to realize a new shift in your perspective.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Start by taking a few deep breaths. As you begin to relax, focus upon your heart center. You might envision a bright light
			swirling or illuminating from your heart. I suggest taking in slow, deep breaths. Hold your breath for a few seconds.
			Then, slowly release your breath. Repeat this several times until you begin to relax. Next, focus upon a simple, positive
			thought. For example, repeat a phrase such as “I am blessed” or “I am love” – just something simple that resonates with
			you. If you are open to chanting, you may wish to say any sort of sacred chant or prayer. For instance, repeat an ancient
			Hawaiian prayer, such as “I am sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. Thank you.” As you surrender to this experience,
			you should begin to feel more clear and centered.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 62 </p>
		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once you are feeling a better sense of calm, imagine you are ascending onto a cloud or a mountaintop. It does not matter
			where your mind leads you; just have the sense of moving to a higher, more distant, and very safe place. At this point,
			or once you have mentally arrived, take a look as though looking down upon your life situation. Begin to see it through
			a more distant, broader, less entangled, or more objective nation, stay open to new insights or information that may emerge.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">This exercise will assist you toward arriving at a broader sense of the relationship dynamics. Perhaps it will offer a
			new realization such as a particular life lesson you may be encountering or other profound wisdom discovered through a
			more objective perspective.</p>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">FOCUS</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When writing a letter, be clear on what your focus or intention actually is. Notice whether you truly want to have peace
			around the matter and heal the situation. Or, are you feeling so indignant, angry, or frustrated that you are compelled
			to only state your case? Getting out of your own way, blowing past your egocentric needs, and being willing to see the
			bigger picture is most important for resolving the matter</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />

		<p class="mb-20">to its ultimate end. After all, working through our relationship issues is one of the best ways for us to grow individually</p>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">THE UNRECOGNIZED GIFT</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">No matter what you are going through, if you pay close attention tunity to glean a better understanding. Try looking at
			your relationship dilemma as though you were watching it on film at the movie theater or reading it as a story in a book.
			Take notice of how you have been acting. What role are you playing… and what role is your significant other cast in? Then
			consider what area within you is not healthy or healed. I believe we create our own realities. With that, how can we blame
			anyone else for what we choose to experience?</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">You can certainly choose not to be a victim of any circumstance. When we are able to move our ego aside and take a closer
			look at the blessing behind the experience, we gain incredible insights. Often, similar situations keep reappearing although
			the character(s) in the story may be different, or the place and circumstances might be new.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is wise to notice the dynamics or underlying theme that rears its ugly head or reappears again and again. This awareness
			puts you on the road to learning the lesson and completing the pattern once and for all. With that in mind, you can</p>

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 64 </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-20">begin to realize the silver lining that is available to all our emotional challenges.</p>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">INTUITIVE COMMUNICATION</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As a deeply intuitive communicator, I can write a letter that carries the universal frequency of love, hope, and forgiveness.
			I believe the letters I write are Divinely channeled through me. Being a <i>channel</i> simply means that I am the conduit
			between my client’s soul’s desire and his or her earthly expression of that by way of the written word. You can learn
			this skill if you are willing to let go of being in charge and are more open to spirit or God’s grace.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">These <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i> carry an energetic frequency that is particular to the person(s) for whom the letter
			is written. Although there are certain elements to consider when writing your letter, it is best not to attempt to compose
			a letter using any type of absolute step-by-step process. These letters allow a higher wisdom to come through when you
			are an open receiver. Therefore, refrain from needing to follow a recipe; instead, be open to the flow of creativity.
			However, just to get you started, I do offer a way to compose your magical <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> by imparting practical
			knowledge and considerations, along with a great deal of wisdom,
		</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">65 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> or do’s and don’ts, and actual examples for composing the various parts of your letter.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In arriving at the bigger picture or theme of the letter, it is important to tap into what the true nature of the situation is. Through this awareness, you can write an effective letter. However, it is most important to
			be open and clear to the higher message, life lesson, or initiation that
			the relationship challenge offers. Once you can identify with the bigger
			picture, the opportunity for personal evolvement, despite the pain or
			heartache associated with the experience, can be received. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Therefore, in order to capture the best advice for writing a powerful influential letter, be mindful of the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Intention:</b>&nbsp;Consider what your true underlying goal is, or what
				you hope to actually achieve through this letter. Check in to make
				sure your intention is not ego-based or part of a power play. In
				other words, try to focus upon the best possible outcome, not just
				for yourself, but also for all parties concerned.</li>
			<li><b>Ego Interference:</b>&nbsp;Find clarity regarding your perspective. Compassion and compromise are two ingredients that are often found
				in resolving a relational issue. Ask yourself, “Is it better to be right
				than loved?” Is the

		</div>
		<ul>
			<li class="list_style_none">perceived power gained by having the last word
				more important than creating or repairing healthy connections?</li>
			<li><b>Creative Writing versus Using an Identified Process:</b> There is no step-by-step recipe for composing an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>.
				Open your heart to receive and your innate wisdom will guide you along the way</li>
			<li><b>Taking the Time:</b>&nbsp;An eloquent letter, instead of a text message, is
				important. It has been taught, “It is not what is said, rather, how
				it is said that makes a difference.” The same is true for written
				communications; how the message is conveyed with the right
				language and stated in a meaningful context is the glue that holds
				the intention. </li>
			<li><b>Keep It Real:</b>&nbsp;Heartfelt communications are just that: being honest,
				vulnerable, and hopeful, while forgiving ourselves and others and
				staying in a state of gratitude for the lesson learned. This is a key
				component to a winning letter. Focusing on these merits is a much
				healthier way for achieving higher knowledge and finding true
				relief. A clear outlook is often realized once the letter is completed. </li>
			<li><b>Attached to Outcome:</b> Sometimes we focus on what we can fix right now. Do not fixate on a desired outcome. Instead,
				let go of trying to control anything. Let go of</li>
		</ul>

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">67 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li class="list_style_none">any worry, fear, or regret. Release any thoughts of how the issue at hand should be resolved. The more we are able to
				trust and surrender to our highest good, the more open we are to experiencing an even better outcome than was hoped for.
				Higher love is letting go of fear. So, take the plunge; mail or give that letter. Then let go, and allow your highest
				good and the good of all concerned to manifest.</li>
			<li><b>Creating the Sacred Space:</b>&nbsp;Make sure you are rested, relaxed, and
				have a quiet, undisturbed, appropriately lit, and otherwise comfortable space that is suitable for writing or keyboarding. (Some people
				prepare themselves by taking a soothing sea salt bath or walking
				in nature before settling down to write.) Then create your own
				inspired writing space in the atmosphere that feels good for you.
				You may consider placing scented candles, flowers, art, or crystals
				nearby. Make this a place for gathering your thoughts in a serene
				environment that sings to you or invites your heart to open.</li>
			<li><b>Ritual:</b>&nbsp;This is optional, yet I suggest that a ritual may not only
				empower your mental or emotional outlook regarding the matter,
				but it may energetically enrich the communication process
				altogether. Some engaged in the</li>

			<li class="list_style_none">process of healing through letter
				writing are drawn to ritualize the letter’s invocation as a type of
				mantra. This may include the use of guided visualizations, such as
				seeing the letter in a shimmering white, peaceful blue, or golden light, while feeling an essence of love as it heals any negative emotions. You may find satisfaction with lighting candles, or
				 reading the letter aloud as a prayer. In certain instances, you might
				consider burning the letter, burying the letter under a full moon,
				or sleeping with the letter under your pillow. Any ritual you are
				drawn to may be a rewarding element that captures and marks the
				essence or intention of the message as a sacred invocation. Simply
				saying a prayer or positive thought aloud, such as, “More peace,
				harmony, and love is given and received through this letter,” may
				further enhance and empower the results.
			</li>
			<li><b>Intuition:</b>&nbsp;In my experience, trust and allowance are the keys to
				opening your intuitive channel. Tapping into your innate intuitive
				process may be different for you than for someone else. In order
				to allow Divine information to come forth, it is imperative to be
				relaxed and to focus upon opening your heart while disengaging
				from obsessive, intrusive thoughts or relying solely upon your
				mental analysis. This may be guided by your breath and</li>

		</div>
		<ul>
			<li class="list_style_none">simple trust that a higher wisdom or guidance will surely emerge. </li>
			<li><b>Trust:</b>&nbsp;It is a fine blending of knowledge, awareness, asking for
				the highest or best outcome for all involved; and believing you will
				safely arrive at your destination, or rather, at the most appropriate
				written expression for the situation at hand. </li>
		</ul>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Like anything else, the more confident that you become, the more pleasure you will derive from this form of letter writing.
			In time, writing these <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i> may become as joyful an experience for you as it is for me.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">ORGANIZING YOUR THOUGHTS FOR LETTER WRITING</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Typically, before I ghostwrite a healing letter, I usually ask the following questions, or ponder the following considerations
			that better equip me for organizing and writing an <i>Inspired Heart Letter:</i></p>

		<ol>
			<li> What is your true heart’s desire? In other words, if the ultimate
				wish could be granted, what is it that you hope for that would
				create the absolute best results? Holding</li>
		</ol>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 70 </p>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li class="list_style_none">a space for your heart’s
				desire, or for what you believe is the ultimate results of your
				letter, is a starting point for dialing in on your true intention.</li>
			<li>What perceived fears or obstacles are there? Consider what most
				likely, or may possibly obstruct the best or desired results to occur.
				The first thoughts that come to mind are usually the most obvious
				fears, yet by delving a bit deeper, often there is an even bigger
				fear or perceived obstacle that is underlying and usually more
				difficult to readily access. (More discussion on this is to follow
				later in this chapter.)</li>
			<li> What background or history between you and the person receiving
				your letter may influence how your letter is received? Consider
				not only the presenting problem or issue, but look at the background and history of the relationship. Further, explore your
				personal history and the personal development and history of
				your significant other. Notice possible emotional scars or imprints,
				including family history, cultural expectations, rules, roles, or
				persistent relationship patterns both positive and unhealthy.
				Think about anything that may have influenced your relationship
				dynamics or may have contributed to the current situation. Look
				at any possible blame, shame, </li>
		</ol>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">71 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li class="list_style_none">or self-hatred patterns or tendencies
				toward chronic victimization. Power struggles, whether overt or
				covert bullying tactics, or any patterns of manipulation should
				also be acknowledged. Instead of playing the “blame game,” work
				toward creating a radical shift for taking responsibility, or for
				admitting your own contribution to the issue at hand. Be willing
				to pause. Take time out for a deeper sense of self-reflection. </li>
			<li> What is your gut telling you? Check in with your own intuition.
				What feels out of alignment? Sometimes, there are silent messages
				that surface. During those times, you may experience bouts of
				confusion, since you may be hanging on to something that is
				what you expected, but is just not realistic. When you stop, and
				really delve into your feeling state, then you can come to terms
				with the answer that you actually know however unreal or out of
				step it may be with what you originally considered as true. This is
				when the intuition kicks in. Once you arrive at that still-point, or
				align with your heart center, and when you are able to trust your
				own gut feelings despite social, cultural, family, or self-imposed
				expectations, then the written word begins to take on a life of
				its own.</li>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">THE MECHANICS FOR WRITING AN EFFECTIVE LETTER</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Knowing just how to formulate your letter onto the page is an
			important feature for writing a powerful letter. Unlike email notes or text
			messages, personal letters are in a class by themselves. The notion of the
			letter, or what you are striving to convey, is the most salient part or the
			meat and potatoes of your message. How the letter is written projects a
			certain tone, cadence, and sentiment. Writing from the heart with access
			to logic and wisdom is the key component. For actually putting your letter
			together or weaving your thoughts and words in the most compelling
			way, the following points are noteworthy:
			</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Most importantly, when writing your letter, remember the language,
			or specificity of words, must be carefully considered. This is where the
			magic of “reframing your thoughts” can perform wonders. Your expressed
			language should invite your recipient to be open, to allow forgiveness,
			gratitude, and appreciation to occur. It is only with compassionate
			communication that the healing can take place, or at least, an opening
			for resolving the conflict can be inspired. The letter is</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">73 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">not aimed at being
			right, or proving a point. Letters that heal do not shame or chastise
			anyone. They are not guilt-laden, nor do they seek ego-gratifying revenge
			in any way. Letters that carry a negative agenda even on a subliminal
			level will not be very effective and may even backfire, creating more
			confusion or upset. Just how your words and phrases are strung together
			or how your letter is formatted is immensely important. Just like a song,
			letters carry a certain melody that can be either pleasing or out of tune. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">One of the best ways to capture the interest of your letter’s
			recipient is to begin your letter on a positive note. Even simply stating
			how often you think of the other person or how you hope the letter finds
			them in a state of peace starts a more inviting flow. Perhaps you may
			consider painting a beautiful scene with your words as the backdrop
			to your letter. For example, <i>“On this cold winter night, while snuggled
						under a comforter next to a roaring fire, my thoughts turn to you…”</i> This
						creates a sort of image or visual that calls for a more open, warmhearted
						feeling for the reader.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-15">NO NEED TO COMPLAIN</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Next, while it is important to state the direction or concern regarding your letter, make sure you do not use</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 74 </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">depreciating phrases or words that make the recipient out to be wrong or inadequate, such as,
			<i>“You just do not know how much I really care.”</i> Instead, a phrase such as
			<i>“I would love the opportunity to show you just how much I really care.”</i> is much more compelling. Letters that allude
			to griping, sniveling, or groveling, are real turn-offs. For example, <i>“You do not really understand
						how I feel.”; “You never had to endure what I went through.”; “I felt so
						devastated after you left.”; “Why can’t you understand how this feels for
						me?”</i> or <i>“I don’t think I can make it without you”</i> are definite DO NOT approaches to effective letter writing.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Rather, a more positive, open, and confident style or a way whereby
			you are not fixated on your personal pain but focused on just how the
			situation may be resolved is really powerful. The focus of your words or
			message should create a deeper compassionate understanding around
			the conflict. Ideally, your letter should convey a true intention for finding
			a way to rectify or begin to heal a situation.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">These <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i> often serve to provide an improved
			sense of clarity. Moreover, upon writing the letter, you may be surprised
			at how your original feelings shift from initially seeking some type of
			power, control, or even revenge, to recognizing the actual reason for
			why the problem has</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">75 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">occurred, while, at the same time, compassionately
			forgiving yourself and anyone else. It is a deeper process and quite
			powerful when you take the time to earnestly consider how you have
			contributed to the situation at hand. Perhaps you reacted indifferently
			or offensively; poorly communicated your grievances before things got
			out of hand; or simply turned a blind eye and remained in such denial,
			the conflict was allowed to persist or grow.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Once you have achieved a newfound personal awareness regarding your possible underlying motive and degree of contribution to the
			issue at hand, the next step is to find a way to truly forgive yourself. This
			raises your personal awareness. You have now evolved and broadened
			your capacity to face the dynamics for your concerns, perhaps through
			new eyes. Then, there is an opportunity to accept the current reality or let
			go of what you may not be able to influence, change, or control. If you are
			able to surrender and hope for the best, the healing begins.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-15">SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE PROBLEM</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Be patient. Be kind. Again, please understand that there is nothing
			positive to be gained just by proving you are, or were, right and the other
			person is somehow wrong.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 76 </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">Recognize, own, and accept your and their
			human fallibilities, yet, be empathetic. We all only do what we know or
			feel is right at the time whatever path was taken; whatever we said or did
			in the moment, it seemed to be the best course of action.
		</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This is not to say your message skirts around the perceived problem.
			However, expressing your concerns or dismay in a softer, gentler or
			even healthier way usually helps to keep your reader open to better
			hear or understand what you wish to express. Otherwise, your reader may
			become defensive or shut down. For example, <i>“I know our children could
						not have a better mother than you. Although we are separated, I hope we
						will somehow help them feel like we are a whole family with two loving
						parents.”</i> Or, another example: <i>“You have been my best friend for all these
						years. I can’t imagine losing our friendship over something said out of turn.
						I would never want to deny ourselves the opportunity to play Bingo together
						when we are in our eighties.”</i></p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A powerful letter can include many elements such as charm, wit,
			humor, sentimentality, sensuality, acknowledgment of the situation
			at hand, the role played, the lesson learned, and always with absolute
			honesty and sincerity. Most importantly, it can offer a way to resolve the
			issue. For example, <i>“I hope you will grasp the true meaning of this</i></p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">77 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"><i>letter,
						what I hold dear, and just how much I adore you.”</i> Or, <i>“If you are open,
						I would love to meet with you over coffee or a walk on the beach.”</i> Or,
			<i>“It would mean so much to me to look in your eyes and share my heart. I
						know we can find a way… together.”</i></p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Refer to a time when the relationship was in a more loving,
			compatible, or healthier place. Include certain terms of endearment that

			letter. Letters that aspire toward taking the high road are creative and
			can influence a sense of love, care, or other positive emotions. Words or
			expressions that are unkind, judgmental, or accusatory are of a lower,
			denser, resonance. They most likely will cause increased anxiety and friction. The person reading the letter may feel angry or upset and
			put-off or reject the letter. Therefore, it is very important to keep the
			overall tone of your letter at a higher, lighter vibration. Avoid dwelling on
			negative emotions, such as shame, blame, guilt, conveying any feelings
			of rejection, or abandonment. On the contrary, offer more open, loving,
			higher states of emotion, such as gratitude, acceptance, appreciation,

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">To illuminate this point even further, notice that instead of

		<ul>
			<li>The words conveyed in this excerpt place a different spin on

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A compelling influence is not achieved through force. Instead,

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I surmised there was a more prevalent underlying truth conveyed
			in Sandy’s resentful letter. Perhaps this related more to her feelings of
			being overwhelmed by her current life circumstance and a sense of
			abandonment. Since Sandy, the daughter, was dealing with so much
			personal responsibility, maybe what arose from her perception was the
			notion that while she felt stuck, her mother had the freedom to leave her
			burdens behind and start a fresh new beginning. Sharon reports that
			this <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> has resulted in a much</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There is a certain frequency that we carry depending on our
			emotional reactivity to any given situation. Emotions such as shame,
			guilt, grief, deception, and jealousy vibrate at a very low frequency. When
			people are aware and dissatisfied with the frequency they are operating on, they can adjust the dial. Most people know their negative thinking
			perpetuates their funk. When you are experiencing anxiety or despair,
			remind yourself of more positive notions such as your finer attributes or
			even what you are grateful for. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Anger also radiates at a lower vibration, yet somewhat higher as
			there is a type of energy behind the rage or resentment that provokes an
			outward expression and moves the otherwise stagnant energy. Yet the
			ability to forgive and accept yourself or another starts to raise the vibration considerably. When we can move beyond that, to the point of feeling
			a sense of absolute love with a focus on gratitude and a willingness to be
			in a more loving, gentle, and thriving emotional state, then the vibration
			shifts and rises tremendously. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is in this higher vibrational frequency, or moving beyond the ego with absolute love, where we create a more loving,

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Awareness of unconscious, self-sabotaging patterns in relationships
			is the key that unlocks the door for finding more love and relationship
			success. Often, a client will ask me to write a letter in order to cause
			the letter recipient to feel shame, guilt, or sadness. However, the <i>Inspired
						Heart Letters</i> are not a means for that sort of power play or manipulation.
						At times, it is quite evident to me that a client is stuck in his or her
						patterns or mired in their unconscious negative programming, with
						limited ability to participate in truly healthy, loving, or connected
						relationships. This is the biggest hurdle to cross as far as writing a
						personal, healing letter for conflict resolution.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">More often, we do not see our own limiting or self-destructive emotional and/or behavior patterns, and we certainly cannot

		<p class="mb-10">Therefore, before composing a letter, I
			suggest you organize your thoughts and consider your patterns and the
			role you played in shaping the relationship you are trying to improve. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Review your inherited legacy, the long-standing family beliefs or
			judgmental views that were passed on to you. For example, you may have
			grown up in a home in which your family considered: <i>Men who cry are
						weak; Women are too needy and never satisfied; Children are meant to
						be seen, not heard; or You can only achieve success through hard work.</i> Consider these and other cultural prejudices that may have limited your
						worldview, and may interfere with your ability to be open to another’s
						perspective. I have named some of the more obvious ones, and you may
						search your own history to uncover others that may be more subtle and
						personal, but every bit as pervasive. Be aware of this as you compose
						your letter.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Write down a list of any previous relationships that were unsuccessful and therein try to locate common threads or similar dynamics that

			you can begin to transform. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With a newfound awareness, you have an opportunity to reconsider which elements in your life are wholesome and which have been

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">AAs we become emotionally and/or psychologically healthier,

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10">DADDY ISSUES</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once upon a time, a client, I will refer to as “Stacey,” (a pretty lady
			in her late forties who had never married nor had any children), asked
			me to write a letter from her to her father. What she revealed to me was
			that she grew up an only child. Her parents were childhood sweethearts
			and maintained a loving relationship throughout their marriage. However, her father developed a drinking problem. When he had too much alcohol, he would often experience blackouts and become delusional. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">During these blackout periods, there were times when he would
			begin accusing his young daughter, Stacey, of outrageous behaviors and
			would not only insult her, but occasionally become physically abusive.
			Stacey described certain frightening events between herself and her
			father in the presence of her mother, including once, at a family friend’s
			party, whereby her father screamed, hit, and even kicked her under the
			table! Stacey recalled these episodes as having occurred when she was
			around the age of seven or eight, or even younger. 
			</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once he recovered from the blackout, her father had no recollection
			whatsoever regarding the horrible incidents. For whatever reason, her
			mother never came to her rescue or confronted her father about these
			terrible attacks (at least</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">93&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">, not to Stacey’s knowledge). While her father was
			never held accountable, she never once blamed her mother for failing
			to protect her. Actually, she described her mother as being very fragile,
			innocent, and angelic. Stacey believed that her own soul came to earth to
			watch over her mother. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Stacey claimed that while growing up, her mother always treated
			her in a loving, kind manner. On the other hand, Stacey described her
			father’s usual behavior toward her as distant and aloof. She had no
			recollection of her father ever being affectionate or nurturing toward
			her. However, as she was growing up, she did appreciate his efforts for
			attending every one of her sporting events without fail. Over time,
			it seems her father did seek help for his alcoholism, and his blackout
			episodes finally stopped. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Unfortunately, her mother passed away from a malignant brain
			tumor when Stacey was about thirty years old. Shortly afterwards, her
			father married a woman with adult-aged children. He seemed to start
			a new life without really including Stacey. Moreover, she had come to believe that her father had maligned her to his new wife, who in turn
			shared his misgivings with her own children. As a result, Stacey felt her
			dad had both abandoned and betrayed her. What was even more painful
			was that Stacey never understood why their relationship was so difficult.</p>

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 94</p>
		</div>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although she visited on occasion, Stacey never quite felt welcome
			in her dad’s home. Ironically, and yet not surprising, she earned a living
			as a practicing alternative healing-arts therapist who specialized in women’s
			intimacy issues. Her heart seemed to be in the right place, and she had
			made strides toward her own spiritual and emotional evolvement, yet
			she could not recognize or accept her own underlying resistance to being
			able to face the truth and change her outlook. Instead, she placed much
			of her focus and energy upon others, especially her father and his need
			to change or transform. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Stacey contacted me to write an <i>Inspired Heart
						Letter</i> to her
						dad, she happened to share that her now elderly father had previously
						promised to leave her some valuable real estate as her inheritance.
						However, when she pressed him, he refused to produce a copy of the
						will. It seemed that she never really knew where she stood with her dad.
						However, more recently, with her encouragement, her father started
						checking in with her via cell phone on a regular basis. Despite this, she
						did not trust that he actually cared enough or would carry through with
						his promise to leave her the home. It seemed as though Stacey believed
						that if only her dad would produce the evidence of that promise, she
						could

		<p class="mb-10">finally feel validated by him. In other words, Stacey needed a more
			visible, tangible confirmation of his love. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At first, Stacey led me to believe that she only desired to enjoy a
			more honest, open rapport, have a more authentic bond with her dad,
			lay all grudges aside, and feel that she was a welcomed part of his family.
			However, in my experience with her, it did not take long to see that
			Stacey continued to resist coming to terms with the past and was not
			truly ready to forgive her father. She seemed almost obsessed with a
			need to have her father openly acknowledge his awful behavior and cold
			indifference and ask for her forgiveness.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I cautioned Stacey that it would be unwise and ineffective to come
			right out and ask or demand an apology from someone. It was even less
			appropriate to bring up a possible inheritance matter, at least at this stage,
			whereby the focus of the letter is better served not through condemnation or other power plays, but rather, by sharing a higher intention and allowing
			the door to open for a better sense of emotional integrity. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When we stand in our power and live in grace, we can encourage
			a purging of outworn patterns in our relationships with others. We may
			even inspire that long-awaited apology or admission to be said. After all,

		<p class="mb-10">is a bully? They are only people with a sense of
			limited power, or a misguided need for more power. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although Stacey claimed to have worked on her own healing over
			the years, it was evident to me that she was unable to lay down her sword
			and be at peace. Often, in dysfunctional families who are struggling
			with alcoholism or other addictions, while the elephant is in the room,
			the family places its focus on other more benign or acceptable things to
			complain about. I surmise that it was simply too painful for this woman
			to realize that her dear mother failed to protect her and that her father
			was never called out for his terrible drunken behavior during her
			formative years.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Stacey kept returning to the issues surrounding her possible
			inheritance rather than coming to terms with her own deeper wounding
			from her father’s egregious acts and lack of emotional support, including
			her mother’s failure to stand up for her. Sadly, she seemed to lack a
			sense of feeling connected, not only to her father, but to anyone else for
			that matter. Perhaps this caused her to inherit some rather unhealthy
			perceptions about life in general along with certain outworn misguided
			coping skills.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Her beliefs about her family dynamics, most likely, carried over into her personal life experiences. As a result of remaining
			stuck in an old pattern of emotional lack and</p>

		<p class="mb-10">limitation, and other negative beliefs,
			she continued to live her life quite alone, usually feeling as though she
			was on the outside looking in. At the time of our encounter, Stacey had
			been unable to find a lasting romantic relationship that she could really
			trust or rely upon. </p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Referring to the old Buddhist saying: <i>To judge someone
						is like
						drinking a glass of poison and expecting the other person to die.</i> We must
						first claim ourselves, which then transpires into an emotional healing
						for the situation at hand. Again, while feeling accepted by others is a
						universal need, we must accept ourselves first. Although, our relationships can definitely serve to enhance our life experiences, they cannot
						and <i>do not complete us</i>.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There is no redeeming value in either being vindictive or scratching
			old wounds. Sometimes, there is a secondary gain for hanging on to old
			emotional pain such as gaining sympathy and attention from others.
			However, it can also deprive us from maintaining a better focus for
			moving forward and taking the right action. Wouldn’t you rather have
			the issue resolved? </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>Inspired Heart Letters</i> often create an even bigger healing for the person sending the letter as it can serve to
			be a type of bridge that allows us to transition while letting go</p>

		<p class="mb-10">of the past without further bitterness.
			Ideally, before composing a compelling letter, the possibility of selfsabotaging tendencies or other emotional obstacles should be contemplated, realized, and released. That course-corrects the intention for a healing to take place. In my experience as an intuitive letter writer, often
			it is not until the letter is written that the client sees the obvious truth
			and finds relief.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Letters are not a panacea, but an element that can contribute to
			the wellbeing of the letter writer. In Stacey’s case, writing the letter may
			have opened her up to the possibility of seeking professional therapy for
			issues the letter itself helped uncover. Based on her agenda, I realized
			Stacey was not ready for an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>. Her relationship with
			her father remains a work in progress, and the proposed letter was a first
			step toward healing, certainly not the last.

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-15">MORE ON THE TONE AND FLAVOR OF THE LETTER</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While several letters and letter excerpts are contained in the
			following chapters of this book, it is most important to take note of each
			letter’s style and intention. Some of the letters discussed are written in a
			rather bold, straightforward, unabashed style, which intuitively ignites a
			more radical shift. Other letters are written with more neutrality or offer
			a

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> compromise, or even to humbly call forth and recognize what faulty
			judgment or previous mistakes have been made by the one issuing the
			letter. Certain letters focus on what is to be gained by finally putting the
			grievance to rest. Such letters may invite the recipient to meet the other
			halfway in order to resolve a conflict, pointing out that no one really “wins” while illuminating how much more there is to lose by continuing
			to battle over old, outworn issues. Still, other letters serve to rekindle or
			inspire more love to occur simply through acknowledging the merits,
			beauty, and gifts that are received through a loving connection. There
			are letters that are a long, overdue plea for forgiveness and convey a deep
			sadness and regret for one’s emotional ineptitude. Yet, some letters serve
			to allow the person issuing the letter to intrepidly move on with integrity.
			This type of message is a powerful way to clean up the past, and acknowledge the gift, whether it is finding healthier boundaries or other initiations
			of self-awareness. It is also a way to recognize and finally put an end to
			unhealthy emotional and/or behavior patterns. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">If you consider that the written word is powerful and carries an
			energetic resonance, then the letters are formidable written communications that require careful thought and purity of mind and heart. In short,
			the best advice for composing a truly heartfelt letter is to be aware, stay
			open,</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">STORIES AND LESSONS SHARED</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In the following chapters, I share some of the more dominant
			dynamic relationship themes. You may recognize some, or many, of these
			common issues for the familiar thread running through them, which
			you may relate to as pertinent to your own life or the lives of other people
			you know. Again, this allows us to become more tolerant, and compassionate, and glean a deeper understanding when we feel disappointed or
			frustrated with others or ourselves. These stories and letters may teach us
			to recognize that we are not alone. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Simply know that these are universal heartfelt challenges, and
			there is a delightful vibrational shift that occurs when we rise above the
			ego and let go of fear in order to reach for the truth. Life is theater in the
			sense that while scenes, roles, costumes, and dialogues are different, the
			language of the heart remains unchanged.</p>
