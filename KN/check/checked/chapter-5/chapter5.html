		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-40">DIVORCED & STILL FIGHTING: WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS? </br>
			FRACTURED FAMILIES/CO-PARENTING</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The shattered dream surrounding divorce often holds feelings of betrayal, or shame, and regret. Perhaps a sense of being lied to, duped, or somehow <i>ripped
			off</i> is ultimately experienced. Other feelings including
			resentment, guilt, or even a sense of relief may arise. A profound sense of
			loss or abandonment from a shattered marriage can shred your self-esteem.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Yes, the reality of the split is experienced no matter the circumstance that led up to the dissolution. Unless there is a well thought out
			mutual agreement followed by a sense of fairness, consideration for one
			another, (possibly even friendship), divorce is usually a very nasty piece
			of business. When it involves children, the simpler breakup becomes a
			deeper, more painful wound, known as the fractured family.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Divorce is the death and the demise of a dream. A grieving process
			to one degree or another is surely experienced. Marriage is the ultimate
			investment in every sense of the word. Some may argue that raising
			children is an even bigger investment. However, I draw the distinction
			that under healthy circumstances, raising children is <i>the most selfless act.</i></p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The parent-child relationship dynamic is obviously a much different
			dynamic than a relationship between adults. Along with the natural
			heart-opening experience that occurs from the moment you hold your
			baby; caring for your child, or children, brings about an unconditional and
			relentless love no matter what.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When immense time, energy, faith, trust, hope, and the vision of
			all that marriage holds dear is annihilated or the investment does not pay
			off, it is certainly quite devastating.

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">Falling out of love with one another,
			or knowing your spouse has fallen out of love with you, is sadly tragic.
			I am not sure whether the term “divorce,” otherwise known as “The D
			Word,” actually refers to the words, <i>draining</i> or <i>devastating</i>			 instead. Being
			married generally offers a certain social/emotional status. Culturally, for
			many women, it lends a sense of security, or mutual support, opportunity
			for nest building, and proof of worthiness, as well as a feeling of being
			desired, valued, and loved.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For most couples, the notion of marriage may mark a personal
			sense of having arrived, or to yourself and the outside world, you are
			considered more established. For some, it may feel more like being a <i>grown up</i>.  There is a certain sense of safety and maturity, perhaps for
			setting mutual goals for family, lifestyle, and/or just growing through life
			together. Marriage marks a change in identity. You are now, (check the
			box), a married couple. You were pronounced <i>“man and wife and from
				this day forward, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until
				death do you part…”</i></p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In other words, marriage may be considered a traditional mechanism for survival, personal identity, growing community, a sense of
			family, family legacy, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, the divorce rate
			has exponentially grown over</p>

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 266</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">the last fifty-plus years. The concept of
			commitment has been trivialized to one degree or another. Divorce has
			become all too common and socially quite acceptable.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Today, it seems many couples more easily look at opting out of
			marriage rather than rolling up their shirtsleeves, diving in, and working
			through their issues. Further, there are those who have a keen awareness
			of the price paid for divorce. Of course, some couples remain in unhealthy
			marriages for monetary reasons, feeling it is too financially costly to
			divorce. Many may feel “the attorneys are the only people who benefit
			financially,” or the idea of selling their home or assets, paying spousal
			or child support is daunting. However, what I am referring to is the
			emotional price paid by the whole family.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When children are involved, it does become a family crisis, since
			naturally the parents are not divorcing their children, but their homelife will never be the same. Unfortunately, more often the parents are emotionally driven and not always prepared for all of the real-life
			negative ramifications or the drama that can occur. It can be a very trying
			process to co-parent, maintain relationships or decorum with previous
			in-laws, even long-standing mutual family friends, and most importantly
			provide a sense of healthy family values, environment, and connections
			for all the children.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“AND JILL CAME TUMBLING AFTER”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, years ago, I attended a rather posh dinner party and
			happened to be seated next to an interesting man, Ben, an accomplished
			real estate developer. In our conversation, I mentioned my passion for
			letter writing and explained my letter-writing service. He was quite
			interested and, after dinner, he took me aside whereby he began to
			openly share his overwhelming sense of sadness regarding a recent
			situation that had transpired with his daughter. This is his story:</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ben married his college sweetheart, Jillian. Jillian was very pretty
			and quite intelligent. In fact, she was the valedictorian of their college.
			Ben and Jillian were wed soon after they graduated. However, it seemed
			that this couple had different agendas for what their marriage would
			be like. Somehow, they each assumed that the other shared their goals
			when, actually, Ben and Jillian had very different ideas for building a
			family and enjoying life experiences together.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ben’s idea was to travel, see the world, build his business, and
			experience life together with Jillian before settling down and starting a
			family. Jillian, on the other hand, wanted to</p>

		<div class="mb-40">

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">
			start having children right
away, buy a nice family home, and move forward with her teaching
career. In fact, soon after their wedding, Jillian became pregnant with
their daughter, Meghan, followed by two more children: their sons,
Daryl and Jason. According to Ben, Jillian really enjoyed being a mother.
She was absolutely dedicated to their children and preferred just staying
home with them as opposed to spending quality or romantic time with
Ben. Cooking and sewing were her favorite pastimes.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While Ben devoted much of his time to building a very successful
			business, he and Jillian rarely socialized or vacationed just as a couple together. In the years that followed, he began to despair, feeling imprisoned by what Ben described as their couch-potato lifestyle. Over time,
			Jillian had gained a considerable amount of weight, although their love
			life was starving.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ben truly loved and adored his three children; however, he felt
			trapped, disillusioned, and held deep feelings of missing out on other
			aspects of life while condemned to living in an uninspired, boring
			marriage. Ben felt he was a man of honor and a loyal husband and father.
			Despite his complaints, Jillian seemed uninterested in changing their
			home-life situation.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This went on year after year. Then, after ten years of</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">269 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">marriage, Ben decided to call it quits. He and Jillian divorced. What followed, however,
			was unexpected. After the divorce, and over the following ten years,
			Jillian completely cut Ben off. She refused to communicate with him.
			Moreover, she did everything in her power to sabotage Ben’s relationship
			with their three children and strove to drive a wedge between them.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Jillian created obstacles in any way she could in order to disrupt
			communications between the children and their father. She hijacked his
			letters in the mail as well as emails and phone calls. Ben had moved to
			a nearby state, where he expanded his business even further. He bought
			a small plane and regularly flew to meet his children for visitations.
			However, as the kids grew older, they seemed less inclined to spend time
			with their father. This is quite common, since developmentally, most
			teenagers often prefer to hang out with their friends instead of with their
			parents. The connection with his kids, however, began to dwindle even
			further. His daughter, Meghan, came to visit him one summer; however,
			she was often defiant and disrespectful toward her father. Ben felt Jillian
			had brainwashed the kids against him.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Shortly before my meeting with Ben, he had returned from Meghan’s high school graduation. He lamented that</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 270</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">his daughter never actually
			invited him to her graduation ceremony, or any family celebration
			surrounding the event. Nevertheless, he took it upon himself to fly up
			and attend as he did not want to miss out on this important occasion;
			and he wanted his daughter to know he cared enough to be there anyway.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While Ben maintained that his daughter seemed pleased to see him, and she was polite and respectful, he felt a significant
			disconnect between them. Moreover, he described feeling as though he was on
			the outside looking in at all three of his children during this significant
			family celebration. Sadly, Ben claimed he did not feel as though he was
			really a part of the family. Ben was at a loss for words. After all, this
			was an important step in his daughter’s life. He loved her dearly, and he
			desperately needed guidance for reconnecting with her.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Ben asked me to write a letter on his behalf to his daughter,
			Meghan, I emphatically declined. However, I did offer to write a letter
			for him to his former wife, Jillian. At first, Ben seemed horrified. He
			explained that Jillian was extremely stubborn, recalcitrant, quite mean,
			and she had refused to speak to him for over ten years!</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I replied by letting Ben know that in order to heal their family rift,
			I must write to Jillian. A window had to be opened. (It seemed to me that
			at the core of this fractured</p>

			family scenario was Jillian’s sense of total
			rejection from Ben and his inconsideration for leaving her to raise their
			children, for the most part, as a single parent.) Ben finally agreed that
			I should write his letter to Jillian. Here is what turned out to be a most

was well worth his fear of rejection or more negative interference from
Jillian. Ben agreed, said a quick prayer, and dropped the letter into
the mailbox.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After two weeks had passed, Ben contacted me complaining that

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The following week, Ben called me with such elation and a deep

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Ben’s willingness to move past his fears and let go of the power

		<h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10">Marilyn’s Story</h3>
		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“UNCHAIN MY HEART”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This letter-story is about a middle-aged lady, Marilyn, who
			was divorced over sixteen years prior to my encounter with her. Her
			marriage had lasted for nearly twenty years. She and her former husband,
			Martin, had raised a daughter and son together. Their children were
			nearly grown, or teenagers, when they divorced. Marilyn described her
			marriage to Martin as being rather typical. She maintained that while she
			and Martin argued on occasion, they got along well for the most part,
			and there wasn’t any clear-cut issue she could name that served to be
			the culprit for destroying their marriage. In fact, when, seemingly out of
			the blue, Martin decided one day to pack up his things, move out, and
			subsequently file for divorce, Marilyn was shocked, to say the least.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">She felt like a boat without a rudder. During all those years of marriage, she relied on her husband and believed they
			would always be together. Within a few years after their

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">divorce, Martin met someone,
			remarried, and moved on. However, sadly, Marilyn remained stuck. She
			was frozen in time. She could not wrap her head around the reality of her
			marital breakup. She felt like a failure, and what’s more, she felt unclear
			about why their marriage did not last to begin with. She had lost her
			identity as a wife. She felt uncomfortable being a single, divorced woman.
			As a result, she succumbed to bouts of depression.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Instead of working through her feelings of grief and sadness
			surrounding her failed marriage, Marilyn, found herself bewildered
			and emotionally crippled. She did not possess the stamina to move
			on and create a new life on her own. In certain ways, she became codependent
			regarding her relationship with her children. They were her
			top priority, and she did everything she could in order to preserve their
			connection, even at the cost of being disrespected, unappreciated, or
			taken for granted. In the aftermath of the collapse of her marriage she
			radiated a lack of self-confidence that usurped the regard her children
			once had for her, and made her an unattractive prospect for future
			romance.
			<i>Regaining</i> a sense of self-worth and confidence, often initiated by a heartfelt letter, makes you more likely to
			<i>attract</i> a worthy partner, or <i>repair</i> a faltering relationship.</p>

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">279 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Martin left so unexpectedly, Marilyn experienced a profound
			sense of rejection. Even though her children were older, she could
			not bring herself to entertain the idea of dating, or meeting someone
			new. She felt quite insecure; her heart was broken. Thereafter, Marilyn
			withdrew and completely shut down. In fact, since her divorce from
			Martin many years ago, Marilyn had only dated two men and each for
			only one single date. When I met Marilyn, she was miserable. After
			talking with her, it was clear that she had not only given her power
			away, but she was inadvertently punishing herself through a life bereft of
			romance, and drenched in absolute loneliness.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-40">She realized she had never healed from the perceived rejection
			surrounding her divorce. Nor, had she honored herself by moving
			forward and being open to finding love again. Further, she had apparently
			forsaken herself from experiencing a healthy, close relationship with
			her children and the respect from them she deserved. Here is Marilyn’s <i>Inspired Heart Letter:</i></p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In my experience working with couples over the many years, it
			seems to hold true that, typically, the wife, or female, primarily creates
			the template, or sets the tone, for the relationship. In other words, she

			whole and what role</p>

			she plays in their connection. The significant other,
or husband, is in the position to RSVP, or accept this invitation.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For example, as the gatekeeper to the relationship, she initiates the
			actual boundaries. If she considers herself as a queen, she will naturally
			exude a type of regal air that commands devotion and respect, if not
			adoration. If she believes she is a princess, the relationship may also
			be highlighted in certain ways. For instance, she may cue her beloved
			to indulge her, to be more protective, to consider her feelings more, or
			perhaps treat her with gobs of gentleness and care.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">On the other hand, if she sees herself in the rather negative light of <i>chambermaid, dowager, slave girl,</i> or even <i>court jester,</i> she may find herself being treated as such by her hubby. By this, she may find herself with a rude, demanding, whiney,
			insensitive “power freak”, who may exhibit any number of other <i>“ick factors”</i>. Her <i>other-half</i> may even have
			a false sense of entitlement and not take her reactions too seriously, or have any real appreciation for all her wifely
			efforts.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">If the couple eventually divorces, the ex-wife may drop her jaw

		<p class="mb-10">personal boundaries, or what we truly know
			is acceptable versus unacceptable behaviors from our significant other,
			is one of the primary ingredients for a viable relationship foundation.
			To fully acknowledge our feelings and remain present in any given

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">In order to remain on the path toward marital bliss, the following is true for both husband and wife: Not enough can be

			Plan</i> can be extremely useful. The following is designed, in particular, for couples who are either in a committed
			relationship or married:</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-15">POSITIVE CONNECTION SUPPORT PLAN</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>What is the presenting problem behavior? Be clear about exactly
				what attitudes or behaviors you may be experiencing from your

				mutually desired relationship bliss.</li>
			<li>What is the obvious or underlying cause for the negative behavior? For example, what consciously or </li>

		<ul>
			<li class="list_style_none">unconsciously seems to drive
				the annoying or unacceptable actions that your partner exhibits?
				Is he or she seeking more attention, (either positive or negative),
				from you or others? Are the behaviors a way for avoiding certain
				responsibilities or marital duties that are perceived as unpleasant?
				Is your spouse or partner suffering from a poor self-concept, or
				diminished self-esteem, or perhaps, has an unconscious pattern
				or need for drama or conflict? Does your partner feel disempowered
				and resorts to controlling, deceptive, or other negative
				behaviors as a sort of power-play? Is there a situation outside of
				your marriage or relationship and independent of you that is
				affecting your beloved’s mood or actions that is adding fuel to
				the fire? Try to recognize the driving force behind the undesired
				behavior(s).
			</li>
			<li>Ask yourself, <i>what is within me or my sphere of influence</i> that
				may contribute toward a positive change in my marriage? The
				following areas may be considered:</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Routine: </b>&nbsp;Can there be an effective change in the usual, or daily,
			routine? Predictable schedules or routines can offer a sense of safety
			and assurance. However, they can also lead to a more humdrum, boring
			marriage. So, consider changing out of the usual rut to experiencing
			something new together.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 290</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">This can be something as simple as going on
			a week-night date, finding a new restaurant, taking up a hobby or sport
			together, taking a gourmet cooking class or going wine tasting, walking
			on the beach, picnicking in the park, taking a ballroom dance class, planning a romantic get-away, or working out at the gym before going
			straight home after a stressful day at work. The list is endless.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Environment: </b>&nbsp;Are there any irritating physical or emotional
			circumstances in your environment? Changing elements in the environment
			can include anything from extricating yourselves from meddlesome
			in-laws, finding more satisfying work, setting the dinner table with fine
			china instead of plastic plates, wearing sexy lingerie, buying luxurious
			new bedding, putting the kids to bed earlier, turning off the television or
			computer, applying some fresh paint on those drab walls, changing your
			color scheme, getting your teeth whitened, and upgrading your wardrobe,
			to decorating your home with fresh flowers, etc. Consider anything that
			can improve the feng shui, or noticeably be added, removed, or changed
			right away that enhances and provides beauty and comfort to your
			emotional or physical environment.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Patterns: </b>&nbsp; What types of negative patterns or predictable behaviors,
			including typical responses, play out in your</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">291 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">relationship? What is the
			couple’s usual, albeit ineffective, conflict-resolution style? For example,
			when one partner is disappointed, since the other arrives late to an event,
			does that partner tend to accuse the other of being irresponsible and
			inconsiderate? Or, does the other partner become defensive and either
			argumentative, hostile or perhaps, shuts down, ignoring the situation, in
			a sense, runs away?</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There are many ways in which couples fall into unhealthy ways of
			problem solving that can be either aggressive or passive aggressive. These
			negative power-play routines can seem like a broken record over time.
			The trick is to notice these miserable worn-out old tunes and consciously
			decide to jump to a new groove, or change to a better track. For example,
			if one person tends to be critical or insulting, instead of acting defensively,
			(which typically may result in an argument), the other partner may try
			a different type of response. He or she may reply in an unperturbed,
			yet sincere manner with, <i>“I am sorry you feel that way. Perhaps we can
			discuss this another time.”</i> Then, simply walk away. In other words, avoid
			the drama. Do not bite the bait! Refuse to participate in rude or aggressive
			interactions.</p>


		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Rewards: </b>&nbsp;What can serve to positively reinforce change? Again, look at what your husband, wife, or partner may desire
			for him or herself and what your goals are as a</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 292</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">couple in order to raise the happiness quotient. Allowing or providing desired rewards or outcomes, while staying within
			your own boundaries or comfort level, is quite powerful. Positive rewards can be tangible or intangible as long as they
			impart a sense of acceptance, encouragement, gratitude, and love. A kiss alone is a tangible reward. A sense of emotional
			safety is not something you can see or taste, yet it may be reinforced by a tender or passionate kiss, verbal praise,
			or gratitude such as just saying the words, <i>“I love you,”</i> or simply by holding hands. In the words of Helen Keller,
			<i>“What is most beautiful
			is not seen with the eyes, but is felt within the heart.”</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Acknowledging or appreciating one another reinforces that universal
			human need for acceptance and a sense of belonging. Performing random
			acts of kindness for one another without expecting it to be reciprocated,
			but only for the sake of honoring your beloved, are rewarding experiences
			in and of themselves. With added unabashed TLC, any relationship will
			flourish with a greater sense of joy and connection.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Give it time: </b>&nbsp; Most likely, unhealthy patterns were established eons before either of you entered your marriage.
			Or, they might possibly stem from your family of origin and early childhood experiences. Positive change can take a while</p>

		<p class="mb-10">to manifest and retain. Consistency, practice, and determination over time will eventually lead to greater success.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Caution: </b>&nbsp;Replacing worn-out, negative, or demoralizing patterns with positive, caring, and more loving interactions
			with your partner can be habit forming.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">With new innovative strategies taking place, check back in a month
			to six weeks to see whether they are effective. Then consider how you can
			work toward a continued re-patterning of your interactions, or creating
			an incentive in one another, for even more positive results.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Confounded by his own victimization and sadness over the loss
			of his partner, (although he maintained a good rapport with Liana’s
			children), Michael continued to be bothered by her nonstop malice and
			profound rejection toward him. He felt he had supported her and her kids
			in every way he knew. Yet, for some reason, even after their relationship
			ended, she chastised him both to his face, to her family, and within their
			community of friends. This became a thorn in his side; Michael was
			tormented and wished to be emotionally released. Here is an excerpt
			from that <i>Inspired Heart Letter.</i></p>

			<p class="mb-10"><i>I know how painful it is to try and pick up the pieces when it doesn’t
				work out. Liana, I’d like you to know that you did once capture my
				heart in a way that made me feel both devoted and protective. The
				underlying truth of our relationship, as far as I was concerned, came
				from a sense of love, connection, and absolute commitment. I opened

				and to spend our life together. Omar’s passing was surely devastating.
				Although I too mourned his death, I cannot imagine the sorrow you
				have gone through and still feel to this day.</i></p>
			<p class="mb-10"><i>Thanks for reading this letter. It means so much to me as I need to
				convey to you, with all sincerity, that I do wish you to find peace. I
				thought this letter might offer a declaration for finally coming to the
				end of the road with no further bitterness, and instead, be replaced by
				a truce. I am choosing to reflect upon our time together as a meaningful
				experience. The wisdom and clarity I have gained is priceless.</i></p>
		</div>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After receiving this letter and forwarding it to Liana, Michael was
			able to exhale a sigh of relief. He felt a sense of completion, knowing he
			was an honorable man who was able to accept the limitations of the given circumstances. Michael began an unfettered and invigorating pursuit of
			joy. And, oh, by the way, his golf game improved!</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When a marriage or committed partnership ends, a chapter in life

		<p class="mb-10">to reclaim yourself in such
			a way that feels cleansing and renewing. Moving on <i>without</i> a sense of
			emotional completion from the past, or <i>without</i> forgiving yourself and
			your former spouse and finding a real appreciation for the experience,
			is a way of anchoring yourself to the past. (You will notice that I refrain
			from using the term <i>Your X.</i> “X” is what you see between the skull and
			crossbones on a bottle of poison and has very negative connotations.
			Often people refer to the title “X” in a disrespectful manner. The term
			“Former” however, does not demean or humiliate the person you once
			thought the world of and were willing to share your future with. Instead,
			refer to them as your “former spouse,” because there was a time when
			they truly did give form to your life.)</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Often, the process of true emotional release after a parting of ways
			can take time. The transition from being married to being single once
			again is a real adjustment. We are creatures of habit, yet our personal
			evolvement arrives only when we dare to break out of patterns and outworn
			negative habits or lifestyles. By letting go of the past and staying
			hopeful, we meet life head on and can courageously step, hop, run, or
			skip forward free falling into new possibilities.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">DIVORCE AND CO-PARENTHOOD</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While we must take responsibility for our own happiness, when
			children are involved, we cannot overlook their interpretation and
			experience of the divorce. Our children may not be emotionally equipped
			to let go, and simply move on. If the parents struggle with this endeavor,
			imagine how painful it is for the kids.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There are definite hardships to raising children as single parents,
			not to mention that the kids end up dividing their time into visitations
			between parents, house-hopping while being denied the experience of
			being all together and part of a whole family. Moreover, kids of troubled,
			separated, or divorced parents, may find themselves feeling caught in the
			middle, forced to divide their loyalties and having to choose sides while
			wanting to please and feel connected to both Mom and Dad.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Over time, this may lead the children to manipulate their parents
			as the parent(s) continue in a power struggle to win their child’s affection
			and allegiance; each parent may even attempt to emotionally, or even
			physically, distance their children from the other.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is quite common for the children to play the game of aligning
			with one parent or the other in order to receive</p>

		<p class="mb-10">more, whether it is more
			power, more privilege, or tangible goodies. Hence, the term Disneyland
			Dad. That moniker simply describes how a divorced father, for example,
			may pamper, or spoil, his children out of a sense of guilt, or instead of
			running the perceived risk of losing their parent-child bond.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Every situation surrounding divorce has its own challenges or
			complexities. Striving to create and maintain a sense of home for the
			children, no matter their ages, will pay off over time. Consider your child
			or children, one day, grown up, pulling out the family album, and reflecting
			upon their childhood experience, or adolescence. Leafing through the
			pages of time, just what does that look like?</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">We cannot erase the past or take back lost opportunities. Raising
			your children, guiding them through their childhood, only comes along
			once. Our family history is marked by events that are imprinted in our
			hearts. How wonderful for any child, no matter his or her age, to see
			both parents proudly and comfortably attending their birthday party,
			graduation ceremony, wedding, the birth of their grandchildren, not to
			mention holiday celebrations, or other family events.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In order to be part of the important, family gatherings, and not
			miss out on these special occasions, calls for both</p>

		<p class="mb-10">parents to see the
			advantages of maintaining a positive rapport between one another. As
			difficult as it may seem, maintaining a sense of unity through being part
			of a dual-parenting team is strongly encouraged in order for your children
			to be less traumatized or feel disenfranchised and miss out on being part
			of a more connected family experience.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With this healthier dynamic in place, parents can better negotiate
			their differences in parenting styles or values and decisions. Together
			you both can be actively engaged parents, supporting your kids through
			any number of childhood/adolescent, or even adult, personal challenges.
			Without enumerating upon the current statistics, let’s just say that your
			children will benefit in countless ways when you, the parents, agree to put down the sword and find an amicable truce, or learn to get along, even if
			it is only for the sake of your kids, and especially when your children are
			not adults.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Most certainly, there are situations that obviate maintaining a
			congenial connection with your former spouse. Only emotionally
			reasonable, healthy, mature parents are able to put their grievances and
			their egos aside in order to allow for a more copacetic post-marriage
			parenting experience.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“PEARLS IN THE SAND”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once. I wrote an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> for a woman, Maya, who
			was about to divorce her husband, Brett. She had two young sons; the
			youngest, Justin, was born from their marriage, while her older son,
			Joshua, was born from an earlier relationship in which his father had
			been estranged from Joshua since his birth. Honestly, I do not recall the
			actual circumstance which led to this marital split, however, Maya was
			determined to end the relationship, seeing no chance for reconciliation.
			At the same time, she consciously chose to let go of, or dissolve, any
			negative feelings associated with her marital experience. Maya had an
			earnest desire to complete their divorce in a clean, honorable, and
			reassuring way. Here is her <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>:</p>

			<p class="mb-10"><i>Thank you for being such a loving Daddy to our Justin, and for

			<p class="mb-10"><i>Whatever your feelings are at this point, please know that I completely

			<p class="mb-10"><i>Life seems to have its own way of awakening us so that we may find

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The sentiments expressed in this letter are a mother’s heartfelt

			Gratitude should be included in our daily affirmations. It truly carries a
