		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">SCHMOOZING WITH THE IN-LAWS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Most of the stories I have shared with you originated when someone had a problem that needed to be addressed and resolved with an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>. Being that this book revolves around healing relationships, I feel compelled to include a model to emulate.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One story comes to mind about a young woman who learned a
			great deal about living in grace with very lovable, interesting in-laws.
			This lady, let’s call her, Emily, married a very handsome, ambitious young
			doctor named Aaron from the East Coast. Aaron was raised in a large,
			rather loud, boisterous family that displayed a great deal of energy and enthusiasm. In fact, according to Emily, it took a while to comprehend what was actually being said, or shared, amidst the rather “cling-clang” conversation at their dinner table. Everyone tended to converse simultaneously. She could barely get a word in edgewise.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Instantly, Emily saw where Aaron received his incredible energy
			and gusto for life. Emily described Aaron’s parents as</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">381 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">both being in
			amazing physical shape for their age. In many respects, they had a
			traditional family. Aaron’s father was from London originally. He was
			highly educated as both a medical doctor and financial accountant.
			Aaron’s mother kept herself busy taking care of the household. She was
			physically quite small, yet she was a tiny ball of fire and cute as a button.
			Yes, she was truly a dedicated wife, and their children were the center
			of her world. Further, Aaron’s mom grew up in Baltimore and was the
			youngest of nine children. Her parents were poor and struggled to raise
			so many children. Tragically, both her parents passed away when she was
			still a child.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The first time Emily met Aaron’s parents and four siblings, she
			and her future fiancé had flown in from Los Angeles to visit them at their
			home in Maine, over Thanksgiving. This was over a year prior to their
			engagement. In fact, Aaron went to the trouble of purchasing a very thick
			tome entitled <i>Hoorah for Yiddish</i> for her to read on the plane. He thought
			it might be helpful if his girlfriend, (who was raised in an Irish Catholic
			family), could glean a better understanding for his family’s Jewish culture
			prior to meeting everyone. Emily found this particular book quite
			entertaining, if not humorous, as it was replete with probably every Jewish
			colloquialism. The book also familiarized her to an ethnically fun sense</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 382</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">
			of chiding. (Apparently, Aaron worried that his folks would not accept Emily, his <i>Gentile girlfriend.</i>) Despite all of Aaron’s hand wringing on
			the airplane, Emily kept affirming aloud, with confidence, that Aaron’s
			parents would simply adore her no matter what.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Aaron’s family lived in a large, graceful, New England-style home,
			in an older, established neighborhood. Naturally, while they were certainly
			kind and welcoming upon meeting this true native Southern Californian,
			she knew she was under their shrewd inspection.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The first evening, they all dressed to go out to a fine restaurant
			for dinner. As Emily walked down the staircase, Aaron’s mother came around the corner, looked at her, and exclaimed, <i>“Oh my, that’s such
			a beautiful dress!”</i> Emily laughed in response and said, <i>“What … this
			schmatta?”</i> Upon hearing that remark, everyone burst into laughter.
			Emily’s use of this humorous Jewish saying, which translates to <i>“What ...
			this rag?”</i> was a definite icebreaker.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For the rest of their visit, Emily volunteered to help his mom,
			including with serving the Thanksgiving meal. She was polite and
			genuinely interested in learning about their family; she did her best to
			be as charming and ingratiating as</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">383 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> possible. At the end of their visit, his
			mother shared with her son Aaron, <i>“This one… you can bring back!”</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Well, Aaron and Emily married about a year later. Emily was
			naturally quite insightful, and a caring soul. She was also emotionally
			intelligent. Emily did not readily take offense or go to battle over her new
			in-laws’ tendency to be controlling or pushy. Instead, Emily took stock of
			the family history and dynamics.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Given Aaron’s mother’s insecure childhood history and his father’s
			need to protect, it seems that maintaining their family connection was
			a major priority. Instead of battling with her in-laws just to prove a
			point, Emily tried to be compassionate and kind toward them. As their
			daughter-in-law, she remained openly honest and direct, yet sensitive
			to their position even when she, or she and Aaron, both disagreed.
			Remember, it is not what you say, but how you say it.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">You see, it was more powerful for Emily to remain aware and
			discerning, or to honor her in-laws’ positive traits, and not take their
			differences of opinion too seriously.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Over time, Emily and her in-laws grew to trust one another and
			bond deeply. They ultimately appreciated her candor, respect, and
			light-hearted humor, and she truly looked forward to their visits. One
			time, Aaron’s parents wrote a</p>

		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 384</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">beautiful letter to Emily in which she
			was honored with an amazing compliment. In that letter, his folks
			expressed just how much they always enjoyed spending time with
			Emily on their visits to the West Coast. Moreover, they considered her
			much more than just their daughter-in-law, but more as though she was
			their actual daughter.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sometimes, the daughter, or son-in-law, is better able to draw back
			and analyze the family dynamics and, therefore, recognize certain set patterns or vulnerabilities such as a type of enmeshed, long-standing power play between their spouse and his or her parents. Getting to
			really know your in-laws also gives an opportunity to further explore
			and understand how your spouse’s behaviors or attitudes may have been
			influenced or formed.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">I am led to share this sweet story, since Emily developed a
			wonderfully close and loving relationship with her in-laws over the
			years. At times, it seemed Aaron’s parents’ meddlesome behaviors were
			difficult to bear. However, Emily wisely understood their true essence,
			their ultimate caring, and their heartfelt intentions.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">THE BUCK STOPS HERE</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, I was asked to help with an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> on behalf of a newly married couple, Jeff and Vanessa, whereby the new wife was
			feeling quite slighted by her new parent-in-laws. This was her husband’s
			second marriage. While Jeff had been divorced for nearly five years, he
			and his first wife continued to struggle with co-parenting their two young
			daughters, who were around the ages of ten and twelve. Jeff ’s parents
			were quite wealthy due to their prosperous family business as vintners, a
			business that would eventually be handed down to their grown children. </p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Shortly after this couple became engaged, they traveled across
			the state to meet his parents. The couple was quite surprised when they
			noticed an abundant array of photographs in his parent’s home depicting
			their son’s first wife displayed on nearly every wall throughout the house.
			In fact, the elaborate photo exhibit could almost be considered as sort
			of a shrine, in dedication to their former daughter-in-law.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Upon viewing this, Jeff actually felt more insulted and bothered
			than did his new fiancée, Vanessa. He later questioned his parents about
			the strange photo display. However, his parents remained obtuse to his
			inquiry or remarks. It
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">
				<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
				<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 386</p>
			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">seemed that this was just the beginning of many
				bold acts of passive aggression perpetrated by his parents and Vanessa’s
				soon-to-be in-laws.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Before they wed, while this couple was engaged, they decided to
				live together. At this time, while visiting his folks, the parents hosted
				an elaborate party with music and wine tasting. During this event, Jeff ’s
				mother insisted that her son’s fiancée be formally introduced to their friends and relatives who were in attendance. However, for some reason,
				after making this grand overture, his mother suddenly could not recall
				Vanessas name. Instead, after hemming and hawing, she simply said, <i>“Well uh, this is, uh… is the woman who my son is living with.”</i> Obviously,
				this rather awkward strike below the belt was understood to be a demonstration of just how little his mother accepted or approved of her future daughter in-law. </p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Even after this couple was married, his parents continued to be
				rude while openly praising Jeff ’s first wife, and only finding fault with
				his new one. Yes, it appeared that his parents were conspiring against
				this couple, seemingly determined to try and break up their marriage.
				Incidentally, Jeff was due to inherit a significant amount of wealth one
				day from his parents. Over the years, his folks discussed their family will
				openly with their grown children, including the</p>
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">
				<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
				<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">387 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">details of what was to
				be inherited by whom. Conceivably, this was a way to assert or maintain
				power and control over them.
			</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I was very clear with my advice to this couple. I agreed an <i>Inspired
			Heart Letter</i> was a powerful gesture, and was definitely in order if they
			were to level the playing field and begin to develop a respectful, if not
			harmonious, rapport between the new wife and her in-laws. However,
			I was adamant that the letter should come only from the son and not
			from the newlyweds together. It is important for adult children to assert
			their independence and establish a sense of honor for their spouse and
			children with their family of origin.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is not wise for the new spouse to be placed in the middle and
				be expected to defend his or herself when they are being disrespected.
				Clearly, marking boundaries by making sure of your specific role as
				daughter- or son-in-law, or your role as a parent-in-law, will help the
				relationships within the family to be defined and respected without
				stepping on anyone’s toes.
			</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After listening to their story and delving deeper into Jeff ’s family background, it was apparent to me that his parents were most likely still
				grieving over their son’s previous divorce and the perceived loss of their
				first daughter-in-law. </p>
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">
				<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
				<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 388</p>
			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">They were unable to cope with their defiled family
				identity and the meaning that a divorce in the family held for them.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I learned Jeff’s parents had been married for nearly fifty years, raised two children, built a successful family business, and enjoyed spoiling their grandchildren. Furthermore, they were devout Catholics, and the
				concept of divorce is not considered religiously holy, or in accordance
				with the sacrament of marriage. What’s more, second marriages in the eyes
				of the Catholic church are most often not even validated or recognized.
				Therefore, these devoutly religious parents, presumably, must have felt
				their family was completely torn apart. Moreover, they may have blamed
				themselves in some way for not raising their son to honor his marriage
				vows, especially for the sake of his children, not to mention his soul. 
			</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Jeff ’s parents’ cultural and religious values, their sense of morality, and perhaps their belief regarding their son’s “sinful” divorce, most likely
				had preyed upon their heart and sense of family tradition. Now that he
				was remarried, any secret hope that their son one day would reconcile
				his marriage to his first wife was lost forever.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This couple listened to my appraisal and found a deeper empathy
				and understanding toward his parents’ perspective. The letter was written
				in a forthright manner that clearly laid</p>

			<div class="mb-40">
				<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
				<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">389 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">down Jeff ’s desire for new, healthy,
				acceptable boundaries between his parents and his new wife, Vanessa,
				and their treatment of her. Just as significant, however, was the letter’s
				revelation and sharing for recognizing his parents’ idea of family values
				and even social acceptance. The <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>,  most importantly,
				conveyed Jeff ’s awareness of how his parents must truly feel and thereby
				acknowledged their pain and deep disappointment.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In this powerful <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>,  Jeff was perfectly willing to assert his manhood and independence at all cost, even if it meant jeopardizing his inheritance. Obviously, he knew he could not be responsible for,
				or control, his mother’s or father’s point of view. However, the letter itself
				let it be known that unless they were willing to allow him to live his life
				without asserting their judgment, rudeness, or reprimands, and instead
				act graciously toward his new wife, he must walk away.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Jeff ’s parents seemed astonished after receiving this letter. They contacted him immediately. And so began their journey to recover their
				family virtue through a deeper clarity, acceptance, and a way of finding
				forgiveness. This was, indeed, a blessing.</p>

			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10"><i>Adding to the Mix</i></h4>
			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">STEPPARENTS AND STEPKIDS</h4>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It can be quite challenging to suddenly step into the role of stepmother or stepfather, let alone suddenly become someone else’s new
				stepchild when your parent decides to re-marry. This is especially true
				when a child begins to realize that one or both of his or her parents
				has not only not reconciled their marriage, but, instead, has found a
				replacement for what the child may feel could never ever be replaced:
				their whole family being together again with their real mother or father!
				This is very tender territory for any new stepparent to tread upon.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I have spoken with many stepparents over the years, even the
				significant others of divorced parents, and commonly they feel the same
				way: pretty much stuck in the middle of someone else’s family drama
				with plenty of egg shells to walk upon. This predicament is felt while
				trying to maintain the adult romance and partnership, (and get through
				all the awkward stuff, such as finding your place in the new family
				paradigm), while at the same time needing to figure out just how to grow
				a sense of comfort between you and your new stepkids. </p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">What may complicate matters even more is if there are</p>
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">

				<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">391 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">children
				from both adults who must now, also, contend with accepting their new
				stepsiblings. What’s more, there can be another layer of confusion or
				even further relationship challenges when both original parents re-marry
				and dual sets of stepparents, and even dual sets of stepsiblings, arrive.
				Yikes! Now that does sound complex. This is not to mention a mix of
				histories, parenting styles, and child-parent dynamics that is somehow
				expected to blend into a viable extended family constellation. Whew!
				I get exhausted just thinking of that!</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Looking a bit closer at the potential for overwhelm and upset,
				children are, for the most part, egocentric beings who are in serious need
				of wholesome parenting. Being a parent is the most responsible, dutiful
				act you can ever imagine. It is twenty-four-seven nonstop care, worry,
				organizing, and planning.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While wholesome parents offer so much unconditional love to
				their children, they also need to harness enough energy to keep up with
				so many obligations. As you know, it is the parents’ responsibility to impart healthy values, set rules and expectations for good charactershaping, and instill other virtues, (such as responsibility, respect, patience, kindness, appreciation, consideration, and simple social decorum), not
				to mention, at times, play the referee in their children’s conflicts with
				others. Moreover, parents must make sure their</p>

			</div>
			<p class="mb-20">children are physically
				safe and their needs for proper nutrition are met as well as provide
				clothing, shelter, medical care, including tending to their psychological
				or emotional needs. Parenting is a commitment and a journey in and of
				itself. It can be both satisfying and draining on every level.</p>

			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">TERMS FOR ENDEARMENT</h4>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Looking, once again, upon the blended-family challenges, it is
				often too seductive for the stepchild, or children, to refrain from asserting
				a newfound sense of power through manipulating the situation at hand.
				It does not usually take too long to discover whether they can get what they
				want through certain maneuvers such as guilt, rejection, intimidation,
				or other manipulative tactics. The new stepparent suddenly finds he or
				she is <i>shaken</i> until the <i>not-so-blended</i> issues finally become intolerable.
				At that time, usually all Hell breaks loose and the new blended-family
				parents, who are completely undone with frustration, find themselves
				running to their next therapy session.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I recently heard from a dear friend, Rosa, who remarried less
				than a year ago. Her new husband is a wealthy, retired gentleman, with
				two grown daughters. Unfortunately, according to my friend, his two
				daughters have vowed to</p>

				<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">393 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">make certain their dad’s new marriage does not
				last. With that in mind, they have vigilantly campaigned against their
				new stepmother with ongoing spiteful acts of subterfuge. Reportedly,
				these stepdaughters are exceedingly gracious, and complimentary, and
				they actually fawn over Rosa… only in the presence of their father and
				only while Rosa is in the room. The rest of the time, they constantly
				complain about her to their father and have made up vicious stories
				seemingly in order to create a wedge between their dad and his new
				bride. (Presumably, the stepdaughters are set on making sure their dad’s
				new marriage does not last so his new wife won’t be given the chance to
				spend their inheritance).</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Unfortunately, Rosa’s new hubby remains in denial and refuses to
				believe these shenanigans are really happening. For Christmas, one of his daughters gave Rosa a toilet bowl brush as a gift! When Rosa tried to comment about how awful, insulting, and ridiculous the gift was, her husband replied, <i>“Now, Honey, do not say a word; Stephanie spent a lot of
			time researching that bathroom cleaning gadget on the internet.”</i></p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Let’s face it, in today’s modern world, blended families are commonplace and are fast becoming a whole new popular paradigm for family
				structures. My advice is to remain prudent and to err on the side of
				caution. In other words,</p>
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">

				<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 394</p>
			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">be prepared and stay open and flexible to new
				conditions or emotional situations that may arise. Again, consider the
				Positive Connection Support Plan strategy previously discussed, and
				see whether you can introduce new concepts for transforming your new
				blended family into a more wholesome, viable arena for raising healthy
				kids, sustaining a sense of family, and maintaining your bliss.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Yes, indeed, it can be incredibly challenging when you find yourself smack dab in the middle of a whole new family system. A family
				that you did not start and you did not plan for, yet, you have now
				married into. It may be tempting to compromise your sense of right or
				wrong when it comes to lowering the bar for being respected by the new,
				perhaps unfamiliar, stepfamily members or in-laws. Concessions are
				often made for the sake of peace or your desire to feel accepted. Ideally,
				it is best to know your limits and maintain clear-cut boundaries as you
				may be tested in this regard. Stay calm, be cool, just relax… since you
				and your new family members will, most likely, adjust to one another
				over time.</p>

			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">COMPASSION</h4>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There is always a back story, or underlying self-conscious, preconceived reason for maladjusted behaviors. Consider the sentiments of

			<p class="mb-10"><i>them out; Bless them out!”</i></p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I am not suggesting that we defend our honor to the point of
				hostility, or run and hide, refusing to spend time with the evil stepmother,
				the spoiled, conniving stepchild, or the domineering father-in-law.
				However, I am suggesting one try to restore and remain balanced instead.
				Your spouse, or partner, is not likely to divorce his parents, or ever desert
				the children. Therefore, it is certainly not wise to force your beloved to
				choose between you and his/her parents or kids.
			</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Take the high road and do not take others’ negativity personally.
				Rather, try to focus on whatever redeeming value your new family
				members have. If there is a family rift, make sure you are not the cause of
				it. Otherwise, you may not be forgiven.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Should you find yourself stuck in a miserable situation whereby
				you find your new in-laws or stepkids to be unbearable, while it may
				not seem fair, change your thoughts and attitude anyway. If you see that
				your actual power to influence is fairly limited and you see that it is only
				your ego that can be bruised, overlook the boorish behaviors, develop
				a sense of humor, and stop trying to change anyone else. That is why I

			<p class="mb-10"> to another in marriage, know that their family is part of the deed… I mean deal!</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When we try too hard to win the affection or approval from others,
				it can backfire as well. Like the elusive butterfly, the more we chase it,
				the more it flies from our reach. Nor can we demand that anyone love,
				appreciate, or even respect us. We can each become a magnet for loving
				connections through our actions and attitudes. Take very good care of
				yourself. Decide to see difficult people as simply people in need of more
				love, instead. Remember, sincerity must be recognized and trust is built
				over time.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">If you have learned to expect the worst from others, you will find
				yourself always waiting for the other shoe to drop. If you are able to
				step back and begin to recognize just how your thoughts, attitudes, and
				patterned reactions maintain the current dysfunction, then you can

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">By journaling, which will hone your abilities to convert your feelings into language, you’ll be able to re-read and rewrite as your emotions
				shift and the circumstances at hand change. This is also a good way to
				measure your progress, stagnation, or regression, as you flip back to
				pages that may not reflect what you are currently thinking or feeling.
				Furthermore, when you keep a working record of progress and change,
				you can see which strategies work, and which do not.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Writing down your thoughts before speaking encourages more
				thoughtful introspection or deliberation, as opposed to speaking on

			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“DADDY’S GIRL”</h4>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I once wrote an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>  for a woman, Alison, who had suddenly become part of a blended family, inheriting the role of
				stepmother to her new husband’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Sarah. Sarah
				normally lived in Miami, Florida with her mother, and visited her father,
				Tony, during Thanksgiving and every other Christmas; they also often
				traveled on vacation together for two weeks during the summer. </p>
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">

				<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">399 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

			</div>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Tony coveted his time with his daughter. He was concerned that
				they lived so far from one another, and so he always tried to make up for
				lost time by giving her everything she ever wanted, sparing no expense,
				whenever possible.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">More than that, Tony and Sarah enjoyed a variety of sporting
				activities. They loved scuba diving, water skiing, sailing, and even hanggliding together. Prior to her marriage to Tony, Alison and Sarah had
				met one another once during the Christmas holiday as Alison rendezvoused with them in New York City to do some last-minute Christmas
				shopping and for an enjoyable sleigh ride through Central Park. Their
				short encounter, at that time, was quite pleasant. Alison thought Sarah
				was a delightfully charming girl. Moreover, she simply adored Tony for
				being such a sweet, considerate, and gentle father.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alison and Tony truly fell in love with one another. Once, on a
				weekend trip to Las Vegas, Tony won a small fortune at the blackjack
				table. On a lark, the couple grabbed a taxi and headed to the “Chapel
				of the Bells.” The next day, they flew to Hawaii as the new “Mister and
				Misses” to enjoy a romantic honeymoon.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When they arrived at their hotel suite on Kauai, Tony broke the
				exciting news to his daughter. However, after hanging up the phone,
				Tony sighed and put his head in his hands.</p>

			<div class="mb-40">

				<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 400</p>
			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">Alison had never seen him so
				glum. He repeated what Sarah had said during their phone conversation, 
				<i>“Sarah seemed somewhat stunned. She told me that her heart just sank and
					she did not know exactly what to say. She accused me of being impetuous,
					not even considering her feelings, then, she just said, ‘Well, have a nice life’,
					and hung up.”</i></p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although the couple managed to get through their honeymoon,
				Alison could see that Tony had become somewhat emotionally distant
				and preoccupied by his thoughts. Shortly afterwards, they flew to Miami
				to visit Sarah. Alison made sure Tony had plenty of exclusive fatherdaughter time. Alison even gave Sarah a beautiful, expensive, lavender
				jade pendant she purchased while they were in Hawaii. Before they left
				for the airport, Sarah whispered to Alison, <i>“Why did you take my dad
					from me? Now you have ruined everything.”</i> Sarah was crying when she
					hugged her father goodbye.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Over the following year, Sarah became increasingly rude toward
				Alison. She criticized her in every way to her father and confronted
				Alison with sarcasm, accusing her of being a gold-digger wife and other
				nasty comments, such as <i>“Only a real bimbo would have a quickie
			wedding in Vegas.”</i> The situation had spiraled downward to the point
			where Tony refused to discuss his daughter and would not bother to tell </p>

				take Sarah on a European vacation as a high school graduation gift.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">They planned to be gone for nearly the entire summer, leaving
				Alison at home. By the time Alison contacted me, she was at her wits
				end. It seemed the harder she tried to be congenial and understanding of
				her husband’s need to protect his relationship with his only daughter, the
				more Alison felt like an unappreciated interloper, dishonored, and left
				out in the cold. In fact, she noticed some of the original sweetness and
				passion between she and her husband had dissipated.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alison asked me to write a compelling letter from her to Tony’s
				daughter, so she could assure Sarah that she would never get in the way
				of Sarah’s relationship with her dad and to help clean up any misunderstandings that might have caused Sarah to treat Alison with such disdain.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alison was hoping an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>  would somehow magically fix their relationship, so she and Tony could find the happiness they
				deserved. I responded by advising her that her true sphere of influence
				was not with Sarah, rather, she needed to resolve this ugly matter with
				her husband, establish new boundaries for her role as stepmother, and

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Dwayne, an eager young salesman, had been living with his longterm girlfriend, Tanisha, and her ten-year-old old son, Tyrell. He was
				seriously considering proposing marriage. However, although Dwayne
				truly loved her, he was hesitant to make a life-long marital commitment
				since he felt Tanisha was often indulgent and way too lenient toward her
				son. This was evidenced since Tyrell usually was able to talk his mom
				out of following through with discipline. In essence, Dwayne felt the boy
				was running the show. Dwayne also thought Tanisha had a tendency to
				overindulge her son with extravagant gifts and lavish celebrations for
				birthdays and such. Moreover, while Tanisha claimed that she wanted
				Dwayne to play the role of father figure toward her son, when Dwayne
				attempted to impose more structure and accountability upon Tyrell,
				Tanisha usually overrode Dwayne’s authority, backed down on previously set consequences, and caved in to Tyrell’s oppositional defiance
				or demands.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Dwayne was not a meek or mild-mannered individual. Although

				would end up in disaster.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I respected Dwayne’s apprehension and concern. At the same
				time, I shared with him (especially given Tyrell’s age), how important it
				was for Tanisha, at this time, to take the lead when disciplining her child.
				Otherwise, with Tanisha’s tendency to cave in to her son’s manipulative
				tactics, chances are Tyrell would only grow to resent Dwayne over the
				years, and he very well might create a wedge between Dwayne and his
				mom. Given the family history, should they marry, it would be wise for
				Tanisha to assert her position as lead parent in their home and provide
				firm, consistent guidance for Tyrell. Moreover, like all parents, ideally,
				they should aim to develop a more collaborative parenting style and
				work as a solid team.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Both parents in the home will experience more success if they

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One woman I recently met, who struggles with her role as a stepmother, complained that she continues to feel quite belittled by her
				stepdaughter, who is twenty-one years old. She described her plight
				by saying, <i>“Even after nearly five years, I feel as though she considers me
			to be The Wicked Witch of the West.” referring to the classic <i>Wizard of
			Oz</i> story.</p>
	<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My advice to her was to change her emotional image. In a chiding
		way, I suggested that instead of being cast in the role of the <i>Wicked Witch
			of the West,</i> only to be spat upon or doused with water and melt away,
			she might take on the more gracious, benevolent persona of <i>Glinda,</i> the
				<i>Good Witch of the North</i></p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Glinda was known for her kind, caring sweetness. While she
				was admired and quite powerful, Glinda floated above it all in a sort of protected bubble. After casting sweet smiles</p>

				<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">417 &nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
			</div>
			<p class="mb-10">and words of encouragement, Glinda simply faded away. She never seemed to become personally involved with the worry, drama, or fears of the other characters.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Quite unlike the evil <i>Wicked Witch, Glinda</i> Glinda remained neutral, unscathed, and unfettered. She was not one to engage in aggression,
				vindictiveness, or other altercations. Once again, she managed to remain
				above it all. More importantly, and without any interference, <i>Glinda</i> allowed everyone else to walk their own yellow brick road, or path, in
				order to resolve their issues or reach their goals.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Remember the adage, <i>Act as though and you will become.</i> Once again, try to remain poised, beautiful, kind, and with a more gentle,
				unruffled demeanor. Staying neutral and remaining lovingly detached is
				a skill well worth building. In order to maintain finesse and composure
				though, you must remember to take very good care of yourself.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It hurts when we feel rejected or disrespected by others, especially by those we inherit into our family circle. Rather than becoming
				emotionally defensive or depleted, it is much wiser to remain lovingly
				detached, to resist going into battle, and not energize the vindictive or
				aggressive attacks from others. Whatever internal drama other blendedfamily members may be experiencing, do not allow them to drag you down</p>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Emotional strain, including resentment, is a very common dilemma
				among blended families. For the sake of peace and harmony, the new
				stepparent often wishes to step in and confront, or even write a letter
				to their stepkid(s), in the hopes of alleviating their misgivings or angst.
				If you are a stepparent, you should not have to openly plead your case.
				Instead, it is the spouse, the child’s natural parent, who ought to rise to
				the occasion and set the ground rules for maintaining respect and polite
				decorum toward the new stepparent. Moreover, the natural parent
				should explain that any rude behaviors toward their new spouse will not
				be tolerated. By doing so, the natural parent is taking responsibility for
				nurturing and protecting their new marriage or partnership. Therefore:
				Dear stepparent, gently back off and enjoy your marriage. And, perhaps
				pray for Divine intervention.</p>

			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“BRINGING CHILDREN INTO YOUR NEW RELATIONSHIP”</h4>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I must re-emphasize, it is usually pretty tricky to know exactly when to introduce your child to your potential new</p>
			<mbp:pagebreak />
			<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="mb-10">partner. Since we
				are the role models for our kids when it comes to teaching them how to
				build and maintain committed relationships, it is unwise to introduce
				your children prematurely before knowing whether your choice of
				partner will be there for the long haul.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I was once in a relationship in which I understood that we were
				both absolutely committed to one another and planned to grow old
				together. My daughter was already grown and living away from home.
				My significant other shared regular custody or visitation with his tenyear-old daughter, Anna. Over time, I was eventually introduced to Anna
				and we easily formed a very close, bonded relationship. Anna confided
				in me, sharing her secret wishes and worries. I found her to be such a
				lovable, sweet-natured young girl. Moreover, I appreciated witnessing
				how well her father treated her, which only made me feel closer to him.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Unfortunately, the relationship did not last and I was heartbroken. Not only for the loss of what I had envisioned as my future with this man,
				but I grieved deeply for the loss of connection with his daughter, Anna. It
				saddened me to consider that Anna may have thought she was somehow
				to blame or that I had abandoned her without a care. Therefore, I wrote
				the following letter.</p>

				<p class="mb-10"><i>I am thinking of you, and just wanted to send you this note. I hope
				you enjoyed a very special Christmas and celebrated the New Year
				in style. I know we have not seen each other in a while. I have been
				wondering just how you are doing. I heard your Christmas song

				<p class="mb-10"><i>As you must know, your dad and I have taken a break. I think he has

			<div class="bg_blue mb-30">
				<p class="mb-10"><i>beautiful, and impressive you are. I adore
				your creative imagination. You truly are a brilliant conversationalist
				as well. More important, Anna, you are your own person. And as
				you said, you “are not going to pretend to be anyone else than who
				you are.” I wish everyone on the planet had your attitude!</i></p>
				<p class="mb-10"><i>It was my pleasure to meet you and to know you, Anna Banana.
				I know sometimes it can be hard dealing with some of the kids at

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Initially I contacted her father, my former boyfriend, to give him

			<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">A SMOOTHER BLEND</h4>

			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Should you remain dissatisfied with how you are being treated by
				your stepchildren or in-laws, convey your feelings to your spouse and
				encourage them to set new boundaries with their family members on
				your behalf. Be mindful of just where you are placing your thoughts or
				focus. Being defensive or offensive toward blended-family members is
				hardly a guarantee for winning anyone’s respect or admiration. However,
				it is a good way to sabotage your primary relationship with your spouse!
			</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In short, while you are never responsible for another’s happiness,
				or whether anyone else likes or accepts you, be sure to honor yourself.
				Again, locate and acknowledge your true sphere of influence regarding
				others, without needlessly overstepping your bounds. Most often, it is
				best not to fan the flames, or make an issue an even bigger deal. If the
				situation at hand is not fueled with drama or increased anxiety, chances
				are eventually it will exhaust itself and fade away.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Usually when we experience rejection from others, it is based upon
				their feelings of anger and resentment, which is rooted in a deeper sense
				of fear. For many, the prospect of change or the unknown is stressful.
				It may take time to adjust and accept a new family member or circumstance. As I have</p>

				is the foundation for which successful relationships are built upon, and
				that does call for an investment of caring and reliability over time.</p>
			<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Stay focused upon the progress you’ve made, breathe deeply,
				open your heart even more, and become exceedingly compassionate.
				Then, be thankful, since conditions inevitably do change as we change
