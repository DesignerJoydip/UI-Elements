        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">For those of you fortunate enough to be enjoying a solid, committed relationship, you may bypass this chapter. Most
            likely, you have excellent relationship karma when it comes to romantic partnerships and are considered lucky
            in love. On the other hand, others of you may not be romantically inclined, or simply have no desire to date.
            However, for those readers who are fervently negotiating their way through the unpredictable, often frustrating,
            and certainly challenging</p>

            They say the world was created in seven days. For most singles, finding true love, experiencing – you know, that long wished-for
            type of pure-hearted, sexy, and enduring romance – well, that would mean the world to them. However, some singles
            looking for love argue the notion, <i>The good ones are all taken! I am too old. No one will want me.
                I always fall for the bad boys… and they all cheat! Relationships are a
                hassle… you get used, abused, and spit out! Or, There are things about me
                that no one knows, and they are just unlovable.</i> Sometimes, when you feel so completely disillusioned
            by the love you seek; let down, put down, and heartbroken, it is difficult to consider new possibilities or a
            brandnew reality. Yet, what if you could experience a loving partnership that is based upon trust, forgiveness,
            acceptance, sharing, respect, and a deeper passion? Fortunately, as I see it, our world is changing. We are embarking
            upon a time where relationships are deeper, richer, and so much more satisfying. In these transformational times,
            if you believe real love is possible, you can now be awakened to call forth a more sacred union that is blissfully
            enjoyed within a much deeper dimension.

        <h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">Julia’s Story</h3>
        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-30">“STEVIE WONDER”</h4>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Julia contacted me to write a letter after she found herself in a very puzzling predicament with a man she had </p>

        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">107 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>
        <p class="relation_text mb-15"> recently begun dating. She could not help but question his motives. Her suitor, Stephan, was an accomplished businessman
            who enjoyed a wide circle of friends, and was divorced for several years with grown or nearly grown children.
            Stephan had a very happy-go-lucky attitude, was a good father, and deeply cared about others. Julia and Stephan
            met at a Sunday football party he hosted at his lovely home near the ocean. Julia enjoyed his foppish ways and
            sense of fun and felt immediately comfortable in his company. Stephan entertained her over dinners, dancing,
            and going to the movies.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">They had only been dating for a few weeks when Stephan invited her to a local charity event for Halloween. Perhaps
            it was his Dracula costume that foreshadowed their evening and, interestingly enough, Julia dressed as a fetching
            Little Red Riding Hood. What was quite unpredictable, though, was how their evening unfolded.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Shortly after they arrived at the party, Julia, (feeling a bit conspicuous since she did not know any of his friends),
            felt more than slighted when Stephan went on his own to mingle about the room, merrily engaging in various conversations
            and even dancing with other women. All the while, <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i> was left feeling completely ignored
            by this <i>Dracula</i> named Stephan. She felt utterly abandoned and</p>

        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15"> left alone to awkwardly roam about the ballroom disguised in a costume and not knowing a soul! Julia felt ridiculous
            and rather indignant. Yes, despite her beauty and charming personality, her ego took a real nosedive and her
            disenchantment with Stephan only increased. After well over an hour had passed, Julia called a cab and left the
            event without saying goodbye. </p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">In the following days, she became consumed with bewilderment. After all, she initially was very impressed with Stephan
            and felt hopeful that he would make a great boyfriend. He had treated her with so much respect and given her
            ample attention when they were on previous dates. All Julia kept asking herself was, <i>I wonder why he ever asked me out to
                            begin with… I wonder why he took me to that charity ball… I wonder
                           
                            why he left me all by myself… I wonder why he was dancing and talking to
                            other women… I wonder what I did to obviously turn him off ? I wonder,
                            I wonder, I wonder…</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Julia did not enjoy feeling in the dark about Stephan and felt she deserved an answer. Because they had only known
            each other a short time, and since she had never before experienced anything similar on a date, Julia did not
            have the confidence to confront Stephan either in person or over the</p>

        <div class="mb-40">

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15">phone. She knew she might run into him in the community, and she wanted to leave him with the thought that he had,
            infact, blown a wonderful opportunity with her. Julia also wanted Stephan to know she had not overlooked his
            shabby treatment. She felt she outclassed him, despite his social standing, and she would not be victimized by
            that <i>bloodsucking Dracula</i>.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">When I spoke with Julia, her ego was seriously bruised. Regarding past relationship patterns, she showed a tendency
            to put all her eggs in one basket. Julia fantasized, hoping and investing emotionally, before she devoted the
            time to get to know a man. She skipped interviewing and observing him first, which would have allowed her to
            discover his core values and see if they matched up with hers.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15"> We discussed Julia’s history with relationships further. She had been a teenaged mother and married three times previously.
            Her father had been unfaithful in his marriage to her mother. Her mother had married no less than five times.
            When she was a very little girl, she remembers her parents frequently argued. Her father had left them by the
            time Julia was five. While she agreed that her underlying abandonment issues repeatedly surfaced in other relationships,
            she also became aware of her tendency to wish for peace whatever the</p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15"> cost. The price she paid was a constant struggle to communicate her needs effectively rather than defensively.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Stephan tried calling Julia several times leaving messages regarding how he admired her, and how he would enjoy seeing
            her again. More importantly, Stephan wondered why Julia had left the party without him.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">In response to Stephan’s attempts to reconnect via phone, Julia sent him her “Stevie Wonder” letter I wrote on her
            behalf. Although the Inspired Heart Letters are meaningful, they are not remarkably long. To date, the longest
            letter I have written has been no more than two pages in length; Stephan’s letter was no exception.</p>

                that is). I do find you attractive as well, and I also know you can be quite charming. More important, I
                think your heart is in the right place, (at least as far as being concerned with your lady friends). However,
                it is quite apparent to me that our dating styles are very different.</i></p>

                I do wish you all the best, but as far as “dating” goes, we may be better friends than lovers.</i></p>
            <p class="relation_text mb-15"><i>Perhaps we will see one another again at one of these local social venues. Best of luck. I hope you find what
                you really want.</i></p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Stephan replied with a rather lengthy three-page letter of apology. He explained why he had fraternized with the
            other women: One lady was a friend who had recently lost her father, who knew Stephan; another lady friend was
            a business associate he needed to talk with about an important business matter, and so it went. Stephan acknowledged
            his rather boorish behavior and admitted to being self-absorbed and remiss in attending to Julia. He pleaded
            with her for </p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15">a chance to redeem himself.</p>



        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Julia appreciated Stephan’s detailed written response. She considered his open, if not humble, plea to give him the
            opportunity to try to make up for his social ineptitude rather compelling. To further assuage her sense of wonder,
            and to see if their initial attraction could be salvaged, she agreed to see him again.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">At Stephan’s persistence, they finally tried to date for a short time thereafter. However, Julia could not bring
            herself to trust Stephan fully. Eventually, they both agreed to shift from a romantic focus to just being friends.
            Nevertheless, Julia did locate a degree of personal power, since she was able to consider and acknowledge some
            of her internal blocks for obtaining deep emotional connections with others.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">To this day, she still tends, at times, to question her lovability, or whether she can have and keep a loving relationship
            without settling for less than complete respect and unconditional love. I will say, she is definitely finding
            her way though. Julia is better able to find the humor in life, to perhaps not take herself quite so seriously
            while waiting for the other shoe to drop, relationship-wise. Instead, her newfound confidence seems to be reflected
            in her personal aspirations such as a rewarding career in sales and marketing, a valuable </p>

        <h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">Allan’s Story</h3>
        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-30">“REHEATING THE SOUFFLÉ”</h4>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Some time ago, I received a letter request from a repeat client, Allan, who claimed full responsibility for allowing
            a romantic relationship with Cynthia to dissipate and eventually fall apart altogether. Allan had met Cynthia
            during a local Salsa dance class. He found her to not only be very attractive and a great dancer, but he truly
            enjoyed her vivacious personality. Their relationship lasted approximately eight months before it crumbled. Allan
            lamented that he had become distracted with work and health related concerns and simply did not take the time
            to invest in their relationship. Then, before he knew it… poof! Cynthia was gone.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Looking back, the couple had been sexually involved and Allan considered their sex life to be quite satisfying. However,
            Allan believed he came to take Cynthia for granted and thereby had failed to fuel the relationship by giving
            less time and energy or enthusiasm to it. <i>Old habits
                                            die young</i>. Likewise, eventually, their relationship just withered away.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">I contend that a relationship is a separate and vulnerable entity. If it is not cared for and given regular doses
            of love and
        </p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15"> encouragement, over time, it will not grow or thrive. So, while Allan was looking the other way and not focusing
            on what he and Cynthia were creating, months later, he found himself to be quite alone and filled with regret.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Before contacting me, Allan had bumped into Cynthia in the community. She let him know she was dating someone else.
            A few months later, he happened to see her again. This time, she reported that she was no longer dating the other
            gentleman. However, Allan did not sense that Cynthia was open to rekindling their relationship. Soon after that
            encounter, I received Allan’s call.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Allan revealed his sentiments by saying he could not stop thinking about Cynthia, what they could have been, and
            how he had failed miserably by being unavailable. We really looked at that. I shared one of my analogies about
            new relationships with Allan. I told him that the way I see it, most relationships are similar to a pregnancy.
            <i>A relationship is an
                                            actual entity created by the two individuals together</i>.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">The first two to three months, the seed for creating a new relationship, (again the entity) is planted. The prospective
            couple initially is hopeful and anticipates the joy and wonder of bringing in a new relationship. During this
            initial stage, or the first trimester, much can occur. For instance, the seed </p>

        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">117 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>
        <p class="relation_text mb-15"> may not take hold; there can be a sort of “miscarriage” if the relationship is unsatisfactory, despite the idea of
            wanting a healthy relationship. The relationship may be aborted altogether, in which case there are obvious toxic
            or inappropriate values or behaviors that kill off any hope for a relationship to occur. Or, the seed that is
            planted may take root and begin to grow. No matter how much individuals desire to have relationships, sometimes
            a “false pregnancy” is experienced, whereby there was only an illusion of a relationship with no substance to
            begin with. Either way, the relationship is terminated early on.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Getting past this initial stage, or during the second trimester, (approximately six months into the relationship),
            the two are now considered an actual couple; they are officially “pregnant!” They are showing up as a couple.
            However, the reality of the situation begins to set in. The new couple must consider the established commitment
            of exclusivity and the growing responsibility toward one another. Most of all, the relationship must be seriously
            desired and well-nourished emotionally on a regular basis.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">I don’t pass judgment on the shape or parameters of a relationship; some from the beginning are agreed upon, to be
            open, meaning there is not the intent of sexual exclusivity.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15">Most of those who come to me for help, however, believe in monogamy, and a committed relationship that is one-on-one.
            Letters are written with this value of fidelity at the core.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15"> By the eighth, ninth, or even tenth month, or the third trimester, the courtship itself may not be as whimsical or
            flavored by the newness of the attraction. The couple often relaxes and may not put as much effort or energy
            toward maintaining the initial beauty and hope once recognized. They find themselves, on one level or another,
            taking a step back, reconsidering the viability of sharing more time. At this point, they may even look at a
            possible marriage or living together through more analytical, less romantic eyes.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Enough time has elapsed by this trimester stage whereby the less charming aspects of each partner’s personality may
            arise. Each of them may feel secure enough to let their guard down and be less careful about how they are interacting.
            Pause may be given, as they consider, Just what are we giving birth to anyway?</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">I have, so often, seen that at or near the close of the first year invested in a relationship, there is a certain
            quid pro quo, or unsaid contract that is being formed. Sometimes, the emotions formed are not altogether healthy
            or stable and do not hold promise for true love and longevity. This can be a</p>

        </div>

        <p class="relation_text mb-15"> difficult time filled with painful contractions and agonizing labor. Unfortunately, it seems that many couples do
            not have the stomach for it. All too often, they cut their losses and simply move on.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Unlike our parents and other generations before, it seems that we are among a generation that seeks instant gratification
            and has superficial notions of what a relationship is. Too many people seem to have an unwillingness to focus
            on the value of investing, building, and maintaining a truly deep and fulfilling love for one another. On the
            other hand, I also see that the superficial views are becoming worn-out or outdated.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">More people are beginning to seek deeper, more meaningful relationships and wish to know themselves better. They
            want to “step up to the plate and hit a home run” while finding and experiencing the rewards of their efforts
            in the realm of love.

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cynthia wrote back to Allan immediately after receiving his letter. Her response: “Very few men can make me cry.

            able to regain their relationship with a brand-new vision and a continued sense of delight. Actually, in Allan’s

        <h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">Ronnie’s Story</h3>
        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-30">SORRY … I DIDN’T MEAN IT</h4>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">There was a time I was called upon to write a challenging Inspired Heart Letter for Veronica, to her significant
            other, Paul. It seems Veronica, (a very exotic looking divorced woman who was in her early-thirties and of Eurasian
            decent), had completely embarrassed herself when she became rather inebriated at a mutual friend’s anniversary
            party.
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Weeks before, Veronica was in an automobile accident whereby she had suffered some abdominal bruising, a slight concussion,
            neck spasms, and a fractured wrist. Her doctor prescribed certain pain medication to better cope with or ameliorate
            the discomfort. Whether it was ignorance or sheer stupidity, after she and Paul arrived at this party, Veronica
            began drinking Martini’s in conjunction with her medication.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, she seemed rather wobbly, started slurring a bit, and acting emotionally unhinged.
            Ultimately, this resulted in a terrible scene. She hurled insults toward Paul, slapped him across the face, and
            threatened to make his life miserable no matter what!</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">127 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Needless to say, Paul was completely blown away by her outrageous behaviors, insults, and creepy-crazy threat. When
            he realized he could not calm her down, and the experience grew to such excruciating proportions … he turned
            and walked out. Veronica never heard from Paul again.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Naturally, Veronica became quite depressed and remorseful. She kicked herself for her idiotic behavior. Moreover,
            she truly cared for Paul and couldn’t bear the thought of him leaving her especially as the result of her miserable,
            embarrassing and obviously disrespectful tirade. Yes, she was truly beside herself when she called upon me for
            advice. Veronica lamented that although she had tried contacting Paul several times and had also texted an apology,
            he never answered his phone.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">To lend a bit of background, Paul and Veronica had met, per chance, at a local restaurant approximately seven months
            prior. Veronica, who Paul had endearingly referred to her as “Ronnie”, had survived quite a nasty divorce about
            three years previously. Paul was a very handsome, tall man, a few years younger, who was building a successful
            career as an architect. According to Veronica, Paul was the first guy since her marital separation that she actually
            felt a real connection to.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">My heart went out to Veronica as I could sense the pain and anguish she was feeling from not just the embarrassment
            of causing a scene at the party, but the deep remorse she felt for going off the deep end and hurting Paul which
            evidentially destroyed their connection. Well, an Inspired Heart Letter was certainly worth a shot. The following
            is Veronica’s letter to Paul:</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Veronica was genuinely grateful for this Inspired Heart Letter. She appreciated that her message to Paul was an honest
            and very open attempt to reveal where she was without excusing or minimizing her transgressions and out of control
            behavior at their friend’s party. Despite all the worry and heartache, setting her pride aside and coming to
            terms with where her heart was at, was certainly a very forthright and wonderfully brave gesture.</p>

        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Did the letter work out as she had hoped? Apparently not. Paul never contacted Veronica again. He did not acknowledge
            her letter, and as fate would have it, he simply moved on. An important element to their story may be considered
            when we understand how fleeting or fragile our relationships can be, especially in the early stage of development.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Nevertheless, Veronica’s letter did prove to be significantly healing for her after all. The whole awful scene at
            the party was an episode that will never be forgotten. Yet, looking back, in the grand scheme of things, it served
            to be a very huge growing pain, or an opportunity to heal. As a result of her shock and despair, Veronica did
            participate in therapy. Eventually, she was able to purge herself from self-recrimination, and other long-standing
            judgments, regrets, and disappointments. She had given Paul her Inspired Heart</p>

            heart. They have been quite happily married for three years and are joyfully expecting their first child.</p>
        <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Veronica never did lose her heart, and she will never give it entirely away to anyone. Instead, she has grown to
            treasure her own lovability. While she is able to share her heart openly, she radiantly shines wherever she goes.</p>

                <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-30">“HEAD OVER HEELS: TAKING A STAND”</h4>
                <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">One client, Nick, shared his unfortunate circumstance with the woman of his dreams, Lulu. They met through
                    their shared social circle. Lulu was a very close friend of Sasha, the paramour of one of Nick’s closest
                    friends, Carl. Therefore, Lulu was often included at many of the social functions they all attended.
                    Nick was instantly love-struck upon meeting Lulu. He was more than pleased to share time, meals, dancing,
                    and conversation with her whenever he could. Lulu had been divorced for several years. She was raised
                    in the Middle East, and her previous husband was described as <i>über</i> controlling and altogether
                    mean.
                </p>

                <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Lulu’s demeanor was alluring, yet somewhat aloof. While the rather detached Lulu graciously accepted Nick’s
                    dinner invitations, the paid ski trips, tickets to concerts, and other social outings, she remained flirtatious
                    toward him, but never actually responded, even in the slightest way, to his numerous romantic overtures.
                    It seemed apparent that this lady</p>

                    <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">137 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
                </div>
                <p class="relation_text mb-15"> enjoyed being in the power seat. While Lulu enjoyed the social camaraderie and paid entertainment perks,
                    she certainly did not seem very interested in Nick’s company otherwise.</p>

                <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Lulu’s elusive nature continued to wreak havoc on Nick’s emotional wellbeing. There was an obvious inner
                    challenge that pressed upon his increasing desire to win her over. At one point, Nick was able to see
                    just how unhealthy this situation was. He began to resent Lulu for being so charming, alluring, and encouraging,
                    as he always felt in the end that he was being used, or manipulated, before he was simply dismissed over
                    and over again.</p>

                <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">When Nick contacted me to write his letter to Lulu, he was depleted. His sense of total rejection and shameful
                    feelings over being taken advantage of were quite overwhelming. Nick knew that he had allowed himself
                    to experience quite enough of this “weird game-playing.” He no longer desired to place himself in harm’s
                    way emotionally with Lulu. However, he realized that he could not write her off without running into
                    her at the many community social events they both attended unless he voluntarily went into social seclusion
                    himself.
                </p>

                <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">
                    While Nick initially implored me to write a letter on his behalf to discourage Lulu from showing up at these</p>

                <p class="relation_text mb-15">shared social venues, I readily saw that Nick needed to gain a renewed sense of his personal power. There
                    is nothing as unattractive as when someone appears overly invested and far too interested in the reactions
                    of another. When the outcome of your communication with a particular love interest is demanded rather
                    than simply allowed, it just seems to create more emotional unrest.</p>

                <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15"> It was apparent to me that Nick could yield more attention and respect from Lulu if he replaced his anxious,
                    doting pattern with a more polite, yet independent demeanor. At the same time, he could exercise integrity
                    and sophistication with a proper message to Lulu informing her of his preference for new, healthier,
                    and, from his standpoint, honest social boundaries.
                </p>

                    parties and other social events. After Lulu moved on, Nick met someone else and has been enjoying a relationship
                    with this other lady for nearly three years. Nick described his new girlfriend as physically beautiful,
                    considerate, attentive, appreciative, very romantic, and altogether a real sweetheart.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">George was quite enamored by a woman, Sheila; he romantically had dated her in the past. However, back
                        then, the timing seemed to be wrong and their paths went in different directions. A few years later,
                        George and Sheila ran into one another at a local social event and by the end of the evening, they
                        decided to try casually dating one another again. When I was asked to write this letter, although
                        they had been steadily seeing one another for over three months, their association remained platonic.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">With a true sense of style and valor, George had the letter delivered to Sheila’s workplace along with
                        an amazing bouquet of flowers. When he picked her up for their outing the following Saturday, Sheila
                        also had a letter prepared for George, which she read to him in the car. As it turns out, they both
                        shared similar sentiments such as a mutual physical attraction, and a desire to find lasting love
                        and partnership.</p>

                    <mbp:pagebreak />
                    <div class="mb-40">

                    </div>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Likewise, they both cherished their time together as friends agreeing upon George’s terminology that
                        their connection in friendship was “priceless”</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Interestingly, Sheila’s real concern prior to becoming romantically involved with George was she worried
                        about their different political views. Sheila is a staunch Republican and George is a Democrat. Incredible!
                        The thought of denying true love for the sake of politics seemed ludicrous to me, although George’s
                        lady friend obviously held a deep concern for political agendas. Sheila was finally able to share
                        what she considered to be a possible deal-breaker, as well as what she valued as important.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Nevertheless, through this conversation initiated through letters, these two were finally able to shed
                        some light upon their mutual attraction for one another, their romantic aspirations, and George was
                        able to calm Sheila’s fears over their political differences. Open, honest communication may seem
                        daunting at times, but, as was conveyed in George’s letter, “Life is too short not to express what
                        is in one’s heart.”</p>

                    <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“BEFORE YOU BLOW OUT THE CANDLES”</h4>
                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cheryl, a drop-dead gorgeous femme-fatal redhead, who turned heads wherever she went, seemed to end up
                        with men who definitely desired her, yet also felt they had to compete for power when they were with
                        her. Underneath her sultry good looks, she was actually a very soft, gentle soul who craved to be
                        cared for and had difficulty trusting that a man would ever be true to her.</p>
                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">While the men she became involved with were not necessarily physically attractive, they usually were
                        good providers and seemed to offer Cheryl the caring and stability she craved. There was one man,
                        Kevin, in particular, whom she knew over many years. From time to time, they tried to make a go of
                        their relationship. However, it seemed that Kevin resented the attention Cheryl received when they
                        were out together. Too often, he felt compelled to put her down verbally, and otherwise “put her
                        in her place.”</p>
                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cheryl described Kevin’s pattern of behavior as the “rubber-band effect.” He was at times exceptionally
                        romantic, attentive, considerate, and nurturing, while other times, he</p>

                    <mbp:pagebreak />
                    <div class="mb-40">

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">gave mixed messages that seemed self-centered and controlling. For instance, he wanted her to be available
                        for him at his convenience, yet he also wanted her to be independent and get a higher paying job,
                        so she could pay her way.</p>
                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Finally, Cheryl had her fill of the crazy-making drama, and took a time-out by moving about two hours
                        away. She found a high paying position in executive sales for an elegant fashion and lifestyle magazine,
                        and was moving forward with her life. She wished to prove to Kevin that she was intelligent, capable,
                        and self-sufficient.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">There is an inherent need to have completion for matters of the heart. And when it is not achieved, it
                        may become confusing and remain troubling. Despite her relocation and new start in life, Cheryl and
                        Kevin did remain in touch. They even visited one another on certain weekends. However, Cheryl’s feelings
                        for Kevin waxed and waned in synchronicity with his apparent mood swings.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Although she was trying to re-establish herself in a new community, at times, it seemed, Kevin could
                        not keep from antagonizing her, even from a distance. I saw that Cheryl had a tendency to cave in
                        and try to fix their broken relationship. However, when she dishonored herself, by placating Kevin’s
                        ego and denying her own worth, their rapport became</p>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15"> exceedingly difficult. It was clear she also needed to have a boosted sense of personal power.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Once, after Kevin had insulted her on the telephone, he alluded that he had been seeing other women.
                        Moreover, Kevin had not been in contact with Cheryl for a couple weeks. It was nearing his birthday,
                        when Kevin sent a simple, contrived Mother’s Day greeting to Cheryl via text message. Cheryl received
                        it as a limp excuse for keeping her on the hook and called upon me to write an Inspired Heart Letter
                        to Kevin. The letter was Cheryl’s response and, actually, a clear indicator that she was on the road
                        to success:</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Through this exhausting and demeaning experience with Kevin, Cheryl received a huge wake-up call. She
                        claimed that just reading this short, yet significant letter fueled her sense for resolving any emotional
                        loose ends and moving on. She concluded that along with the Kevin experience, her previous</p>

                    <div class="mb-40">

                    </div>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15">choices for potential partners were oddly based in illusion. Cheryl had to learn the lesson of self-reliance
                        and the ability to trust her own wisdom to make sound decisions that supported her personal evolvement.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cheryl learned also to appreciate her innate strength and has definitely developed the determination
                        to find a deeper, healthier, more loving relationship. It seems that Cheryl had difficulty locating
                        her own true core values and subjugated her needs for the sake of being in a relationship, no matter
                        the price. When we have journeyed so deeply into the abyss, yet find our way back to ourselves, the
                        lesson is so profound and so encouraging that it will never be repeated.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cheryl saw Kevin a year later. In their conversation, he mentioned that receiving this significant letter
                        was devastating. In his words, “It just killed me…” I believe this suggests that his power to exert
                        control through his back and forth or “rubber-band” maneuvers had finally been squelched. Or should
                        we say, he finally got it that Cheryl ultimately just blew him off. Furthermore, soon after, Kevin
                        attempted to re-establish their relationship with a vow to marry Cheryl.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Apparently, when it seemed that Cheryl no longer needed Kevin to feel whole and complete, suddenly she
                        appeared more desirable to him. Or, perhaps, Kevin actually</p>

                    </div>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15">recognized her value. An interesting human phenomenon is that we more often hold increased value for
                        that which is earned.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cheryl admitted that her ability to detach without further remorse energetically created an opening.
                        This resulted in a new dynamic between Cheryl and Kevin. I call it the gift of the chase. When someone
                        acts too needy, is too accommodating, or functions in a co-dependent mode, they fail to honor themselves
                        first; they sell themselves way too short and lose their worth in the eyes of the other.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Cheryl gave up pursuing her romantic dream by placing so much of her energy into pleasing Kevin at her
                        own emotional expense. Sometimes, it takes getting really clear, and a well written communication
                        can provide that support. After delivery of this letter, Cheryl actually was able to walk away with
                        her head held high and her personal integrity intact.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">What’s more, Kevin’s attitude toward Cheryl shifted. He understood that he no longer held any real power
                        over her. In that instant, his cocky attitude felt depleted and he began to look at Cheryl with renewed
                        interest.
                    </p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Most likely, Kevin’s ego was challenged by the sense of rejection that surfaced with Cheryl’s newfound
                        independence. As a result, this served to ignite a renewed desire to</p>

                    </div>


                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">pursue her once again. Unfortunately, the energy that could have been positively focused upon building
                        a healthy foundation for love, instead, was spent in a power play.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">For some, real intimacy seems unreachable. They have difficulty trusting that someone will just love
                        them as they are. For them, the quest for love goes hand in hand with pain. The pain they knew as
                        a child growing up is familiar, feels natural, and therefore is within their comfort zone of what
                        they have come to know and expect. It is the underlying wounded heart that gets in the way of enjoying
                        love on a deeper level or in a healthier way.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Although Cheryl and Kevin finally parted company, Cheryl learned a profound lesson by recognizing her
                        own self-worth. That lesson was understanding that being vindictive is not only counter-productive,

                    <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">THE DEARLY DEPARTED</h4>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Not enough may be said regarding the importance of having defined, clear-cut, personal boundaries. Knowing
                        what your own deal breakers are. I call it the Must Be list. If you are in a relationship that you
                        find dishonoring or lacking in integrity, or if your value system is violated, the wisest choice
                        may be to walk away. We do not have the power to change someone else. However, we can inspire others
                        in our life to change by communicating our needs, preferences, and relationship goals.
                    </p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Getting clear on what exactly that looks like is your responsibility. By developing your own personal
                        guidelines, you are taking the first step toward self-reliance. When we can trust our judgment, decisions
                        around relationship concerns are so much easier. This also means that we too can be inspired by others.
                        Staying open to change is positive, but staying focused on what we will and will not tolerate increases
                        our relationship success with ourselves and anyone else.
                    </p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">When we choose to leave a dysfunctional, toxic, or dissatisfying relationship, there certainly can be
                        a grieving</p>

                    <mbp:pagebreak />
                    <div class="mb-40">

                    </div>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15"> process that takes place. We may hold onto feelings of denial and anger or emotionally shut down before
                        finally accepting that it is really over. The order of these emotional states may fluctuate. Once
                        we have concluded that there is nothing else to be done then we can surrender. At that moment, we
                        are ready to finally take that flight into a healthier way of being. Then we can consider new prospects
                        for happiness, and are able to forgive and move forward. There is something to be said, however,
                        for leaving a relationship in style.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">There is another type of healing that is felt when we have regained our personal integrity; when we no
                        longer feel confused, victimized, or resentful, and can hold our head up with real thankfulness for
                        the experience. Moreover, I find it very satisfying to leave a relationship in such a way that denies
                        the former partner the opportunity to redeem themselves at the other person’s expense.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">When someone breaks off the relationship and moves on, the person who was left behind may try to justify
                        the situation by claiming their former partner turned out to be an awful person in some way. This
                        is face-saving ego gratification and a common reaction or coping mechanism for failed romance and
                        relationships. However, if the person who breaks off the relationship presents themself in such </p>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15">way that is beautiful or elegant and offers kindness, compassion, and well wishes, the other partner
                        being left behind may ponder just how he or she could let a fabulous person like that get away. At
                        the very least, there is less opportunity for negativity to follow.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">On the other hand, if we let our emotions get the best of us and leave in a vengeful rage, or with some
                        type of negative drama, the person being left actually may have a sense of relief, since the person
                        leaving acted like such a terrible person. Moreover, it serves to justify the idea that the failed
                        relationship was the fault of that bitch or that bastard, and lets the other person off the hook
                        for sharing in the responsibility for what took place.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">I advise that when a relationship is over, try to put some pep in your step, some glide in your stride;
                        and while it is best to make a clean break, burning emotional bridges along the way can often backfire.
                        This should be considered if you frequent the same local spots or have common friendships or other
                        associations. Should you happen to encounter your previous partner, act graciously, kindly, and even
                        joyfully and discover how self-empowering that can be.</p>

                    <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“BOY IN THE HOOD”</h4>
                    <p>Jennifer knew Greg since she was only four and he was ten. Jennifer always looked up to Greg with deep
                        admiration. Not only were they neighbors, but their mothers were best friends until Greg’s mother
                        passed away some years ago. Their worlds remained connected through this close family friendship.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">At one point, long after each had divorced, they found a type of tender comfort with one another. Over
                        time, they acknowledged their long-time underlying attraction and eventually became romantically
                        involved. Since they each had born witness to one another’s former marriage disasters, knew each
                        other’s children, and otherwise had followed each other’s lives, they had an unusual, yet relaxed,
                        connection.
                    </p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Jennifer yearned to be in a committed, caring relationship. She felt uneasy being alone without a man
                        in her life. Her marriage had been rocky, to say the least, before she and her former husband called
                        it quits.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">She considered Greg to be the “Steady-Eddy” rock; someone she could trust; someone she felt she knew.</p>


                    <mbp:pagebreak />
                    <div class="mb-40">

                    </div>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15">She rationalized that they would be a great match. However, it seemed that Jennifer’s destiny to find
                        true love was not to simply slip into a cushy-comfy relationship, at least, not yet. You see, wherever
                        we go, we take ourselves with us. Unless we can truly face our emotional pain head on and transform
                        it, chances are that sacred wound, that dysfunctional pattern, will continue to wreak havoc in future
                        relationships. And so it was for Jennifer.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Before you knew it, Jennifer dove right into Greg’s arms. Oops! Unfortunately though, despite their long-standing
                        neighborhood affiliation etc., Jennifer soon discovered that Greg was a womanizer. Instead of enjoying
                        the peace and security she so longed for, she found herself snooping in his emails, checking his
                        phone messages, and yes, discovering his two-timing ways with another woman.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Jennifer was quite distraught when she asked me to write her letter to Greg. She was terribly hurt and
                        felt betrayed on many levels. Although their romance was short-lived and Greg was surely a disappointment,
                        she felt even more upset that he did not take her seriously, that he still considered her to be the
                        little kid down the street. Actually, Jennifer felt ashamed that she had thrown herself into this
                        situation without first considering what their mutual aim would be beyond </p>

                                        to realize what I hold dear for my future. I fully realize that I need to
                                        make some real shifts in how I live and approach life.</i></p>

                                        career, but also I can no longer settle for anything less than true love
                                        with a committed romantic partner. My wish is that you receive this

                        to have a growing admiration for her. In fact, he has alluded that he considers himself to be more
                        than a notch below her regarding class and integrity.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Greg made the analogy once by drawing a comparison to Jennifer, considering her as being like a fine

                    <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“BLACK BIRD BYE-BYE”</h4>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Mark, a handsome, young man in his late twenties who worked in the computer industry, had been living
                        with his girlfriend, Georgina, until she lost her job and decided to take a break from life by backpacking
                        through Europe with another girlfriend before returning back home to look for a new job. Mark graciously
                        supported her sense of adventure, and thought to himself, upon her return home, he would propose
                        marriage.
                    </p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">As it turned out, once she embarked upon her European travels, Georgina seemed to disappear off the radar
                        altogether. While he worried about her safety and whereabouts, occasionally, Mark would receive a
                        short phone call or text message. Then, weeks would go by without returning Mark’s numerous phone
                        calls. When they did speak on the phone, Georgina seemed evasive, emotionally cut off, and farther
                        away than ever.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15"> When her money ran out and she returned to America, (some months later), she not only broke off her relationship
                        with Mark, but decided to move back with her parents. </p>

                    </div>


                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Perhaps because she felt unsuccessful in life, trapped, too needy… (God only knows), for some reason,
                        Georgina seemed depressed, despondent, and unable to talk about her change of heart, or why she distanced
                        herself from Mark. Georgina walked out of the relationship altogether through a rather cryptic email,
                        simply saying she had a lot to figure out, needed to be with her family on the East Coast, was starting
                        to see a therapist, and must move on.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">As a result, Mark experienced a profound sense of confusion and betrayal. Moreover, he loved Georgina
                        and was quite worried about her wellbeing. Shortly after this, he contacted me. The following is
                        an excerpt from Mark’s letter.</p>

                        whether friend or lover, out of the blue, just stops communicating altogether. This is really annoying
                        when there was never an argument or an incident you can consider that caused the abrupt silent treatment.
                        You have left voice messages on their phone, and sent countless text messages, even e-mails that
                        go unanswered. You have already checked with mutual friends or relatives and discovered that they
                        are still alive and well. After being dropped like a hot potato, there is not much more to do apart
                        from dusting off your bruised ego and moving on…</p>

                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>Develop a healthy relationship with yourself before you look to find happiness with someone else.
                            Relationships do not complete who you are. They can, however, be an enhancement to your life
                            and to a sense of wellbeing.</li>
                        <li>Treat others as you wish to be treated.</li>
                        <li>Treat yourself as you wished to be treated by others.</li>
                        <li>Take time to compare and contrast your core values with a prospective romantic partner.</li>
                        <li>A definition of a healthy relationship is when each person in that coupling is allowed the freedom
                            to be who they are, (as long as there is mutual honoring and respect), without fear of any negative
                            retribution from their significant other.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Be mindful that healthy, loving relationships naturally complement one another. They do not detract
                            or diminish either partner. I believe this is wonderfully coined in the expression, Why do I
                            have to give up me to be loved by you?</li>
                        <li>Consider what type of relationships you tend to attract. Often, there are common themes or a particular
                            life lesson offered through the challenge, or the satisfaction, experienced when you open your
                            heart to another.</li>
                        <li>Clean up any unresolved negative feelings about yourself or other(s). The need to forgive may go
                            even farther back than you can remember. Infants and children are born with emotions and experience
                            life at face value. Feeling unsafe, unlovable, guilty, ashamed, abandoned, inadequate, angry,
                            or rejected, etc. may be the result of early negative experiences that influenced your sense
                            of self. When we are out of alignment with our true nature and disconnected from our souls, we
                            may create foul, hurtful patterns that continue to show up in our relationships with others.
                            There may be an unconscious negative emotional programming that sets one up for failure.</li>
                        <li>Trust that underneath it all, we each create our own life experiences. We alone are responsible for
                            our happiness</li>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15"> When our hopes are dashed or we feel disappointed, and when our heart breaks, often there are one of
                        two mindsets that develop. The first reaction may be an overwhelming sense of need. I need to feel
                        loved, I need to find love, I need to be in a relationship, I need to finally get married, or (especially
                        for women), my clock is ticking… I need to have children and a sense of family... or I just don’t
                        want to grow old alone. These beliefs are usually followed by an ever growing,</p>

                    <mbp:pagebreak />
                    <div class="mb-40">

                    </div>

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15">(although perhaps unrealized), desperation. The notion that somehow you may never find true love or the
                        opportunity has passed you by sends a radical message to your brain, or to your ego and identity.
                        This instills an underlying yet intense sense of fear. It is almost as though some sort of sink or
                        swim survival mechanism kicks in. Often, this propels the single person looking for love to effort
                        and strive even more in order to find their soul mate. It’s as though they are on a mission and their
                        very sense of ever finding true happiness depends upon finding their own special someone.</p>
                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Unfortunately, what we chase after more often eludes us. All those single bars or meat markets are crammed
                        full of single people waiting and hoping to find their perfect match. Finding the Happy Hour crowd,
                        as you mix and mingle, you may notice that sometimes they are hooking up or meeting someone and sometimes
                        ending up as just part of the “two o’clock shuffle.” While it’s entirely possible you serendipitously
                        meet your perfect partner, you might become vaguely aware that you have lowered your standards, if
                        not your expectations. For some, this might be leaving with someone or even just anyone. Or for others,
                        after another night of disappointment, just shuffling out the door and shuffling home to face yet
                        another day… alone.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15"> When people are afraid, they may become aggressive or act overly seductive trying anything to win at
                        finding love. With all this social bravado, they may wear themselves out trying to impress and actually
                        end up losing their confidence. Fear is like radar. It can fill up the room and be felt with every
                        encounter. When anyone comes across as too needy or desperate, their prospect for finding someone
                        fabulous to love is greatly diminished.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">So, rather than sitting at the edge of your bar stool, leaning forward, with eyes glazed, craning your
                        neck and leering at someone from across the bar, you might want to consider just how very unappealing
                        you may appear. Love is letting go of fear. Stop searching for love. Instead, allow love to arrive
                        because you know it will. You can manifest love only when you are truly available for it and not
                        afraid to receive it nor afraid of losing it. Confidence is a great substitute for alcohol, and without
                        the hangover!</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">The other mindset that may result after enough emotional wounding around hurtful or disappointing relationships
                        is to simply become closed off emotionally. There are plenty of jaded cynics out there. It truly
                        saddens me when I encounter so many single people who are suspicious,</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">untrusting, and actually predict that love is painful, or just not worth the hassle. These single types
                        are so completely wounded that they may decide they are through with love and the sense of being
                        used or taken advantage of, or being lied or cheated on, or strung along for years without a real
                        commitment etc.. I see them as hardened, unapproachable, and to a certain degree living in a self-imposed
                        prison of lonely regret or resentment. Given enough time, unfortunately with a negative attitude,
                        the heart closes and the individual may become apathetic, numb or what is referred to as shut-down.
                    </p>
                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">The shut-down single usually does not want to hear about their friends who are “in love.” In fact, after
                        hearing that a friend has found someone or is newly engaged for example, the news is likely met with
                        a negative reaction such as “So what’s wrong with him or her?… Have you done a background check yet?…
                        Why did she get divorced anyway?… Why hasn’t he ever married before?” The list goes on. Since misery
                        does love company, it may be unnerving for the shut-down friend to consider that one of their own
                        may actually be leaving the herd.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Our experiences especially within the realm of dating and relationships are opportunities in which to

                    <p class="relation_text mb-15"> For the single looking for love, one can contemplate what works and does not work. A deeper personal
                        awareness can then become heightened for finding the right attributes in another that meshes with
                        whom the individuals involved really are. The key is to take the time to get to know someone. Instead
                        of quickly dismissing a potential partner based purely on a superficial list of social status or
                        physical traits, there might actually be an opportunity missed for discovering an emotionally substantial,
                        positive connection.</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Why do we take everything so personally? If you meet someone who turns out to be a jerk, then why would
                        you either somehow make it your fault or draw the conclusion that all men or all women are jerks?
                        Personally, I cannot fathom giving anyone that type of power. After the bad experience with someone
                        is over, that unfortunate creep goes on his or her merry or not so merry way. So what?</p>

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Too often the soon-to-be shut down single wallows in the drama, the pain, and cannot seem to rise above
                        the post-traumatic stress. Take the time to grieve and work through the pain, but not too much time.
                        Life is too short; you are too precious. Avoid judgment, condemnation, or giving up on love. Instead,
                        feel happy that you have managed to extricate yourself from a difficult or unhappy situation and

                    <p class="relation_text relation_text_indent_30 mb-15">Remember, keep your heart open. That is the key. Living in fear of rejection or desperation surrounding
                        matters of your heart is painful and emotionally draining. Shutting down, throwing your hands up
                        and walking away from all hope of finding love is worse. Affirm your own lovability without trying
                        but by being in your true nature, just as you are. Thank God or the universe for bringing your perfect
                        loving partner to you at the right time and in the right way. And be all that you wish to attract.
                        When you are open, clear, and know you are lovable, chances are you will not attract a jaded cynic
                        and you will easily notice and not be so attracted to Desperados or others that simply come on too
                        strong or try too hard. Instead, you might just meet someone who resonates where you do, in a positive,
                        loving space. So relax, trust in the universal law of attraction. Believe.</p>
