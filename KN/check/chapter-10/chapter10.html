        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This chapter offers a brief commentary on other ways Inspired Letters or other writing applications can be effectively
            used that are outside of the healing realms that focus upon matters of the heart.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The following topics in this chapter refer to creative and/or compelling personal profiles or letters and even text
            messages that promote our best selves, or offer other possibilities such as for flirtatious text messaging; successful
            online dating; landing job interviews, or resolving legal or business matters. Although this book is primarily
            focused upon the power of the artfully written letter, the next section is focused upon the merits for creating
            positive text messages that serve to be both alluring and fun.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In today’s world, it can be challenging to meet prospective “soul mates” or love interests, without resorting to
            internet or other commercial means. In fact, this has become so popular that the majority of couples who marry
            today actually met through the internet or through other dating services. Therefore, this is where we begin.</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Coming back around full circle to nearly the beginning of this book, Chapter 3, <i>Dating Dilemmas… Singles Looking for Love</i>,
            I now offer some useful commentary and advice for anyone contemplating finding a love connection via an online-dating
            service, or if they are working directly with a coach or matchmaker. Matchmaking services, including online dating,
            can feel awkward and quite unnatural. Nevertheless, it has been a growing industry and offers a viable alternative
            to a serendipitous meeting of the <i>right one</i>.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Frustrated clients have told me that the photos presented on an individual’s profile often are not current or have
            been Photoshopped considerably. Obviously, the most flattering photos should be shown, yet they should be a fair
            representation of how you currently appear. Moreover, the written introduction should add enough zest, or appeal,
            to capture the interest of healthy, respectable, if not fabulous, suitors.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I have helped several friends and clients by writing their profile for them. After all, in essence, your dating profile
            is a way to promote yourself in the best light possible. It is your calling card, and must be crafted and delivered
            in a way that compels the interest of an appealing and suitable “other.” Based upon my experience in helping
            singles to shine online,

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">the following is sound advice:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Photos:</b> This may be the most important feature of your online profile, especially if you are seeking a love
            match. Look directly into the camera and offer at least one photo with a full smile, exposing your pearly whites.
            A more direct open gaze and soft smile elicit a sense of confident, relaxed sincerity. Dress appropriately as
            though you were meeting another attractive person for the very first time. Again, there is a metamessage depicted
            in your attire as well as in your stance, or body language. If you appear too seductive, or look like you are
            trying out for a centerfold, just realize the type of dating experiences you will most likely attract.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">On the other hand, poor or stiff posture, closed grins, or arms folded or pressed to your side, may convey a more
            emotionally shut down, unfriendly, or persnickety personality.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Only include photos of yourself, although a photo with your pet(s) may be appealing. A full photo from head to toe
            increases your chances for being pursued as well. Hats, sunglasses, and photos in Halloween costumes are discouraged.
            Also, sharing photos of landscapes, sceneries, a sunset view from your balcony, or random photos of rabbits on
            your front lawn, can be detrimental for attracting dates. Photos of your possessions, or toys, such as sports
            cars, motorcycles, jet</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10"> skis, sailboats, or your home in particular, without your photo in the same shot, may be perceived as superficial
            or in poor taste.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Content:</b> Our values or preferences, immediate and future goals, and what we consider meaningful or important,
            may change depending on our social/emotional status or stage in life. Be clear, be open, and be flexible. This
            takes a great deal of contemplation. The better you recognize your “must haves” for your vision of lasting love
            and satisfaction, the more magnetized you will become for meeting the best match for you. Be honest with yourself
            so you can be honest creating an authentic profile for a successful outcome.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This is an opportunity to put your best foot forward and improve your chances of attracting someone special and well-matched
            to you. It is your personal advertisement, and you should present a dynamic profile that will cause a stir in
            the viewing audience.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Flashy bells and whistles are fine if they convey an interesting, fun, or lovable aspect of who you genuinely are.
            However, “come-on” gimmicks, or tricks, should be avoided. That will surely backfire, and you will waste your
            time. Your content should be interesting, yet brief. Remember, Less is more, so get to the punch line.</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
            <p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 522 </p>
        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Flavor:</b> Your profile should inspire a sense of intrigue, or mystery that can be alluring. Keep your message
            positive, and add a little sparkle to be remembered by. In writing your content, try to dial in on a sense of
            just who you would like to attract, and write as though you are talking directly to him or her.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Initial Contact:</b> Having decent conversational skills is a must for capturing the interest of a prospective
            date. Most people will be inspired to actually meet in person if the phone dialogue is relaxed, easy, and comfortable.
            It is important to read the entire profile of the online contact prior to having that first telephone conversation.
            Remarking upon some of the highlights viewed on their profile may be flattering.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The art of conversation can be amplified when it is positive or complimentary about the other person. Keep the initial
            phone contact short and sweet. I suggest keeping it less than twenty minutes. Further, I recommend only one initial
            phone contact prior to meeting. More importantly, avoid text messages unless it is to confirm a meeting place
            or time; hearing someone’s voice via a telephone call or voicemail conveys not only their personality, but their
            authenticity, which is a more considerate way to communicate.</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">523&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>The Date:</b> Wherever you plan your first meeting, choose a comfortable spot where you can converse without too
            much environmental distraction, whether visual or auditory. If you happen to enjoy a wonderful connection and
            are attracted enough to see each other again, be aware that your first date will always be remembered. Therefore,
            while it does not have to be a five-star restaurant, or somewhere too extravagant, it should be inviting and
            lovely, if not romantic in some way: perhaps a café overlooking the ocean, a downtown bistro, or a rustic supper
            club with soft lighting and a cozy ambiance. Good table manners and any other touch of class can earn more points
            as well.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Remember, the first impression is just that. Many people sum up their meeting within the first few minutes and in
            those first minutes decide whether there is enough attraction. The actual chemistry or what may be considered
            one another’s energetic field, either mutually resonates or does not. Regardless, enjoying time getting to know
            someone new, despite the romantic outcome, can be part of the fun involved in the dating-service experience.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>The Interview:</b> Often, when meeting someone interesting for the first time, there may be an inclination to
            sell ourselves by impressing the other person with our talents,</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
            <p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 524 </p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">accomplishments, possessions, or other dazzling life experiences. Maintain an even exchange. This is more than a
            date; it is an interview. Be mindful to share conversation. You may consider creating a mental list of appropriate,
            open-ended questions that you can ask your date. Other tacky or boorish behaviors are noticed when the conversation
            turns to current problems you may be facing or past relationship matters.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There is nothing worse than setting the tone for your date on a low note based upon what has not worked for you either
            in divorce court, problems with your children, conflicts at work, or any life experiences that you regret. Your
            date will consider this egocentric and unappetizing. It is much better to wet your lips with flirtatious, upbeat,
            tantalizing, and congenial conversation. Less is more regarding the art of conversation. Monologues can feel
            overwhelming and stifle the mutual social reciprocity that creates an amicable flow.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Another point to consider: Some people have trouble maintaining good eye contact. Personally, I find that poor eye
            contact is disconcerting, if not uncomfortable.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">If the eyes are the windows to the soul, then open them for a direct, clear view. This alone will invite your date
            to want to know you better. First conversations can be awkward for both of you; eye contact is a genuine effort
            to convey who you are and shows your appreciation for this first opportunity</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">to get to know the person across the table from you.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Taking it Further:</b> Should you decide to continue dating, take the time to really get to know the other person
            before becoming physically involved. I realize it can be quite difficult to hold off becoming sexually intimate,
            especially when your attraction and hormones are amped-up. However, if you are sincerely interested in creating
            a lasting romance, then take the time to build a credible, viable foundation.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Spend enough time together to get a sense of how your prospective partner deals with conflict or upsets. If you eventually
            become a couple, no doubt fresh conflicts will arise, and seeing how your new love interest has responded to
            past bumps in the road may give you an idea of what to expect as you navigate your future together. Did they
            invest sincere effort to resolve conflicts in their past relationships, or did they, in your opinion, walk prematurely?</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The most important aspects of a relationship are how, as a couple, you tackle the day-to-day annoyances and the ups
            and downs of life, and do you feel you have each other’s permission to actually be who you really are. Can you
            express to one another your authentic and transparent selves safely and without fear or recrimination?</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>A Final Note:</b> If you don’t feel a special connection or,</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-20">for whatever reason, decide you do not wish to see the person again – be honest. It is considerate and polite to
            let that person know truthfully, that while you enjoyed meeting them, you are not interested in subsequent dates.
            You don’t really need to provide much detail; it is enough to let them know that you don’t feel the chemistry.</p>

        <h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“BOYFRIEND FOREVER”</h4>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, Lynn, approaching her sixtieth birthday, contacted me to help her write a more dynamic online-dating profile
            as she was not getting much attention with what she had written on her own behalf so far. After reading what
            she had already submitted, it was very clear to me that she had written a short novel instead of simply capturing
            her essence and creating a friendly, and certainly
            <u>not</u> <i>long-winded</i>, invitation for a suitable, (if not the “right” man), to capture her interest.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When writing a personal profile for online dating, a great photo and a simple to read, yet striking message that
            elicits what your personality and true nature are, as well as the essential traits you seek in a romantic partnership,

        <p class="mb-10">easily highlighted and conveyed. Lynn was gregarious, sweet-natured, warmhearted, and wholesome. As an example, this

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">On another occasion, I helped a terrific guy, Tim, rewrite his dating profile. Tim was an attractive, good-natured
            gentleman, who not only had a solid career as an educator, but, among his many hobbies and interests, he was
            quite a talented ballroom dancer. However, creating a provocative, alluring online-dating profile for himself
            was definitely not his strong suit. In fact, when he requested that I rewrite or enhance his current personal
            ad, I found myself chuckling over some of what he had already written. Within his original profile script, he
            actually had included some of the following described enticements:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>“I have a high threshold for boredom. (I will go shopping with you.),”</i> and <i>“I can carry heavy items as well as twist tight caps off of jars.”</i>            Truly, these elements were included in his profile, I am not kidding!</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A very sexy, attractive, middle-aged woman with a fabulous sense of humor asked me to help her to rewrite her dating
            profile. While her current profile was capturing the interest of scores of men, in fact, too many prospective
            suitors to keep up with, her dating experiences were disappointing. It seemed that the men contacting her were
            mainly interested in having a fling, and not really interested in the possibility of finding love. Not surprising,
            after reading what she had written, her profile was decidedly quite flirty and alluring. Flirtatiousness and
            sex appeal are great for capturing a man’s attention, but in order to sort out the frogs from the princes, it
            is also important to highlight what you value and desire to create with your online personal ad.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This woman had no problems attracting men, even just by walking down the street, yet she seriously wanted to find
            a satisfying relationship with a committed partner and avoid wasting any more time with shallow, unfulfilling
            dating experiences. Here is her new, revised dating profile:</p>

            for what she really wanted in a relationship and was taking action by declaring it on paper. Again, the law of
            attraction manifests through our intention and willingness to take action. Within a couple of months of running
            this profile, she met someone quite wonderful. They have fallen deeply in love, and he just recently asked for

        <p class="mb-10">Cary, a man in his mid-thirties. Cary had met a woman through an online-dating service. Her name was Lisa. During
            their first date, despite her youthful looks, Lisa revealed her true age (not what was stated on her profile),
            and to Cary’s surprise, Lisa was ten years his senior. Nevertheless, Cary was instantly infatuated with her.
            He enjoyed her confidence, her style, and considered her to be quite charming with a rare seductive earthiness
            that seemed to radiate a strong sense of passion.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In no time flat, Cary became quite smitten with Lisa and could not deny or hold back his fiery lust for her. By the
            third date, they were consumed by their obvious sexual attraction and found themselves in bed together by the
            end of the evening.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The following morning, Lisa had to leave quite early as she had a meeting with a client at work. Cary found he was
            constantly thinking about her and wanting to spend more time with her. They continued to see one another over
            the next couple months, when, suddenly, Lisa stopped returning Cary’s phone calls and disconnected herself without
            any explanation whatsoever.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Cary was struggling to cope with this unanticipated rejection. He felt very confused and emotionally torn up. More</p>

            angry and felt she had “used him” and tossed him out when she was done.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">He could not understand how she could just cut him out of her life and move on. She was not the <i>hot tamale</i>            after all. Instead she was a cold fish! Cary was pretty emotionally spent when I spoke with him. He requested
            that I write an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> to Lisa as he wanted to take a stand for himself and have the last
            word. After consulting with Cary further and sorting out the pieces, I wrote the following <i>Inspired

                does not occur for me too often. You might imagine how perplexing

                of any concern to me. I only bring this up, since I cannot fathom

            his hopes were dashed and Cary was quite taken by surprise. He was still licking his wounds when he telephoned
            me to share Lisa’s response to his letter. However, through this emotional ordeal, Cary began to develop a much
            better sense of awareness regarding the importance of taking the time to know</p>

        <p class="mb-10">someone’s character, values, communication style, and their capacity for being open, honest, and trustworthy. Feeling
            truly safe in one another’s arms is where the heart can rest with assurance that we are where we belong.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Unfortunately, Cary’s expectations for a committed relationship were, most likely, in contrast to Lisa’s romantic
            blueprint. Intuitively, I surmised that Lisa may have seen that Cary was more interested and willing to woo,
            invest, and commit, however, they were emotionally misaligned. Ultimately, it seemed they each had different
            desires or expectations. The internal flaw is when we are not aware of the hints, or clues that were there, to
            one extent or another, yet went unnoticed or discounted.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Too often, when you are infatuated or smitten by a new love interest, the tendency is to be consumed with the romance
            while convincing yourself that everything is wonderful. Unfortunately, while skipping down this primrose path,
            we tend to ignore or minimize obvious or subtle actions, communications, or feelings that are disjointed or out
            of sync.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Finding out what each other’s agendas are, and being clever enough to fully interview a prospective partner with
            open, honest exchange at the risk of disappointment, is being responsible and prudent. <i>Discretion

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The wind can surely be taken out of your sails when your hopes are high for a reciprocal love connection and caring
            and, instead, they are thwarted. When we feel a friend or loved one suddenly disappears off the radar, or when
            a prospective love interest promises to call and they don’t, we are often left feeling bewildered, indignant,
            or even deeply hurt.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">What would the world be like if we were able to express our feelings with gentle honesty? Sharing the truth of how
            we feel is learned with courage, confidence, and practice over time.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Often people are more focused upon the <i>idea</i> of being “in love” rather than taking a conscientious perspective
            and exploring whether the foundation is solid enough to build upon. They may have difficulty with defining exactly
            what a loving, healthy relationship truly means. Or, on a subconscious level, they are afraid to come to terms
            with the truth, which may be that they have simply deluded themselves.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Relationships of any nature allow ongoing opportunities to learn about ourselves. Looking back on those relationships
            that just didn’t work out often, eventually, causes a sigh of relief. Who we are attracted to today may not be
            the same caliber or type of person we were attracted to in the past.</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As difficult as it may be, try to capture the silver lining and learn the lesson well. Working through the pain,
            instead of refusing to acknowledge what part we may have played in the situation, is a way to keep the denial
            at bay. When we consider disappointing patterns in our experiences with others, it causes a deeper understanding
            and cautions us to move forward without repeating the same mistakes or misunderstandings.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Seeking a competent guide, whether a therapist, coach, or other mentor, and finding natural support systems, such
            as a hobby or interest that uplifts you, enjoying supportive family or friendships, and, most importantly, seeking
            the support that you find through spiritual or religious teachings or community, are ways to honor and nurture

            dropping handkerchiefs or batting their eyelashes. So, who has time for that? And certainly, I don’t know anyone
            who even owns a “hanky”. In my experience, I have never been very enchanted by receiving a text message from
            an admirer. Yet, that is not to say, it cannot be done. I am open to be absolutely charmed. So, let’s be mindful.

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As a woman who loves to flirt, I am certain, knowing how to deliver the right text message can be really powerful.
            Or let’s just say, it does have its advantages within the realm of seduction. If you tend to be a tease, in the
            best sense of the word, you enjoy flirting … or want to learn something more about it, read on.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I am reminded of a truly playful and amazing story.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">Once, I happened to join an international group mostly comprised of women for a weeklong nature retreat to beautiful
            Mount Shasta near the Oregon border. I must say, as a result, most of us received a type of energy boost that
            fueled our enthusiasm for loving life as we were encouraged to just let down our guard, celebrate our inner-child,
            and be more open or authentic. Mount Shasta is a wonderful place to be. It was hard to leave and go back to reality.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Driving twelve-plus hours returning to San Diego in one of the mini vans indeed was a jaunt. Several of us took turns
            driving. I volunteered to take over the wheel once we crossed into Los Angeles County. As I proceeded down the
            freeway, a woman sitting across from me, Audrey, began to share her complete dismay after receiving a disappointing
            text message.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Audrey started off by saying, “Kristine, I really need your help. My boyfriend, Liam, lives in Los Angeles. We have
            been dating for nearly a year. So, I thought I would surprise him with my message.” She went onto say, <i>“Okay, here is what I wrote … Hi Honey, we are driving back
            from Mount Shasta. I am thinking of you. How about we stop by and pick
            you up? You can be the chauffeur and drive us to San Diego … lol”</i> (with a kissing emoji) attached…</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">“OMG! Tell me you did not really say that,” I blurted. I</p>

        <p class="mb-10">sensed immediately that Audrey was just too available, too needy, and way too boring.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">You see, the art of texting has much to do with the less that is said, the more is imagined. When I asked Audrey
            what Liam’s response was, she reported that he wrote the following: “Hi Audrey, while I do have business in San
            Diego this week, I am sure you must be weary from your long journey. So, get some rest, and I will try contacting
            you later this week. If you are available, perhaps we can have dinner on Wednesday or Thursday”</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This was Sunday evening, he was perfectly willing to wait for days to see her. To sum it up, I thought his message
            was rather limp … in every sense of the word. Audrey mentioned that she was so enamored with Liam, that she actually
            dreamt of him the night before. Well, for giggles and kicks, as they say, I began to dictate her following message:
        </p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>“Okay, Liam … sounds good. I just really wanted to share this
            amazing, sensual dream I had about you.”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Within moments, Audrey’s phone was ringing … “Wow! It’s him!” she exclaimed. I cautioned her not to answer. Liam
            then began frantically texting her to please pick up the phone or call him … At that time, I urged Audrey to
            refrain from any communication. “Give it at least ten or even fifteen minutes</p>

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">… for all he knows, you are eyeing a very handsome man who is driving by in a Lamborghini … (lol).” Audrey complied.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After four or five desperate messages from Liam, pleading for her to talk with him. I then suggested she give in
            and respond by texting:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>“Hi, actually, Liam, although the dream was so amazing, there is
            no way we can have a really intimate conversation with all these people in
            the van.”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Without the least hesitation, Liam responded by saying:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>“Audrey, I can jump in my car in ten seconds and see you in about
            two hours!” …
    </i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My how the tides have changed … With that, I suggested Audrey write the following response:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>“Liam, you are so thoughtful. And, you are right. I am weary from
            my long journey. I really need to take a very warm relaxing bubble bath
            when I get home, and then jump into my fluffy, cozy bed. I bet, I will have
            another amazingly, sensual dream about you. Did you say you were free
            on Wednesday or Thursday for dinner? Actually, Thursday works best for
            me. See you then …”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Audrey was truly amazed at how easily her boyfriend, Liam changed his whole demeanor. Instead of the previous</p>

        <p class="mb-10">lack luster “ho hum” response, he seemed quite energized or even desperate to be with her. About two weeks after
            the Shasta trip, I happened to run into Audrey in a local grocery store. She looked radiantly beautiful and glowing
            with happiness. Audrey could not explain it, but ever since the “text message” experience, Liam had been pursuing
            her nonstop. He had sent her a lovely bouquet of flowers the following day, and kept wondering if he could see
            her sooner. She exclaimed how their relationship seemed to jump to a whole new level. In fact, she was looking
            forward to meeting his parents in a couple weeks.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">During our conversation, Audrey mentioned another friend who might need my help. This lady had recently been on a
            blind date, and much to her surprise, she was quite enamored with the man she was “setup” with. Apparently, their
            attraction was mutual. She mentioned that at the close of their date, and as the man moved toward her, (apparently
            wishing for a good night kiss), the woman abruptly turned away.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It was an awkward experience, whereby she didn’t want their encounter to “move too fast” and, at the same time, she
            was really attracted to him. The friend thought, he might never ask to see her again, since, in response, he
            slumped away, saying, “No worries, I enjoyed meeting you anyway.”</p>

        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I suggested her friend simply text the following message … <i>“Thank
            you for a wonderful evening. I enjoyed every minute. I was actually
            flattered when you leaned in for a kiss … but truthfully, I would like to
            really get to know you first. And also, I doubt I would have wanted to stop
            at just one kiss.”</i></p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One of the powers related to text messaging, is that the chances of your message being read via text message is nearly
            100 per cent. Therefore, choose your words wisely. I caution you to refrain from emotional knee-jerk reactive
            rebuttals, off-the cuff remarks, or initiating a message that you might later regret. The safety zone related
            to texting is surely found amongst a more light-hearted, brief, yet open, if not innocent conveyance. Essentially,
            remember “Less is more…” Actual in-person conversations or better yet, delivering your own Inspired Heart Letter
            is so much more thoughtful for communicating on a deeper level. Texting is your Sancho Panchez; the Inspired
            Heart Letter is your Don Quixote. Moreover, e-mails and text messages may haunt you for years to come. So, once
            again, be careful, thoughtful, and intentional regarding your messages.

        <h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10">Nuptials… to Ring Your Bell</h3>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Not only is it quite an honor, but what absolute fun it has been for me to write beautiful, inspired wedding vows.
            I have presided over several weddings as a Universal Life Minister since 1993. I never consciously aspired to
            be a reverend or perform weddings; however, while I was interning for my marriage and family therapist’s license,
            I developed a very keen interest in subtle-energy healing practices. Often, in the midst of a psychotherapeutic
            counseling session, I would sense the client’s energetic, or <i>auric</i> field. Moreover, I could see where
            they were stuck or where their energetic body was suppressed and otherwise not flowing fully with the rest of
            their life-force circuitry. The results offered through subtle-energy work are often quite impressive.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I began to explore the world of alternative healing and shamanism with intrigue and awe. Eventually, I became certified
            in several energetic healing therapies, many of which included healing touch or <i>laying on of
            hands</i> modalities. The most profound energetic healing work I facilitated was when I put all formal training
            aside and just helped clients by relying on my own inner guidance. Soon, I began to develop a new, separate clientele
            as a <i>Healing-Arts</i> practitioner.</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">551 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
        </div>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For legal purposes, it was important to maintain strict professional guidelines and not co-mingle my psychotherapeutic
            clients with those seeking alternative healing through energetic clearings. A dear friend of mine, who taught
            hypnotherapy and was a former Roman Catholic nun, suggested I apply for a mail-order minister’s license in order
            to further protect myself, should I happen to informally counsel a client who was slated for the healing-arts
            practice and not “talk therapy.” Under a pastoral license, healing approaches with <i>laying on of hands</i>            interventions are permissible.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once my friends learned of my minister’s license, I began receiving requests for writing wedding vows as well as
            for presiding over weddings. My initial experience with this was when a dear friend, Michele, was planning her
            wedding to Emil, and she asked me to help write their vows and perform the service. Emil was a devout Roman Catholic;
            he was not comfortable with the idea and insisted that only a Roman Catholic priest must marry them. Nevertheless,
            Michele was adamant that I should be included in performing their nuptials; therefore, a compromise was finally
            made. Both the priest and I, together, would officiate over the service.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Preceding their wedding, I met with the future bride and groom to further plan the ceremony as well as to interview
            them regarding the various elements to be presented in their</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">vows. This included what their heart desires were for building a life together, what they reminisced upon regarding
            their mutual love and experience as a couple, certain ideas for metaphors to be included in the ceremony, as
            well as preferred philosophical points to be made.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The wedding itself was performed in the couple’s beautiful backyard garden in the charming seaside community of Laguna
            Beach, California. I had taken a great deal of time to focus and prepare their spiritual ceremony before sharing
            in the experience of presenting Emil and Michele as man and wife. I recall certain aspects of their vows, such
            as the wedding rings representing a never-ending circle of golden light and love as well as reciting certain
            chosen quotes about eternal love from their preferred author of The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran. I even wore a beautiful
            silk ceremonial type robe that I had purchased during a vacation in Hawaii. I meditated and prayed for their
            marriage to be blissful and blessed for weeks prior to their wedding. In short, I envisioned myself in the most
            spiritually reverent space I could muster.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Interestingly, the priest who was co-facilitating this ceremony was not what I had expected. Rumor has it that he
            had presided over one of Hugh Hefner’s weddings. In fact, while he did not appear particularly pious, and his
            manner</p>

        <p class="mb-10">appeared very casual with a rather off-the-cuff demeanor, he was certainly humorous and brought a delightful sense
            of levity to the occasion.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The most memorable part of the ceremony for me, however, occurred at one point while I was delivering their nuptials;
            I was suddenly overcome with the true meaning of their vows and their souls’ promises. At that point, I happened
            to look directly at the wedding couple and was struck by the radiant light of love that was beaming from both
            of them through their beautiful blue eyes. I could no longer contain myself as my own eyes flooded with tears.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">I am happy to announce that this couple has enjoyed over twentyfour years of marital satisfaction. Now, in their
            older years, they have a son who is off to college; (Michele also has two other sons from her first marriage).
            Together, they enjoy a relaxed lifestyle at their lovely beachside home, a shared mutual interest in the arts,
            and a never-ending bond of love and partnership. As an interesting side note, I recently presided over the wedding
            of Michele’s son, Hunter, to his lovely wife, Maria. Perhaps I am becoming a family tradition.</p>

            am asked to help out with writing cover letters: letters of recommendation and letters relating to a variety
            of legal matters, including lawsuits, marriage settlements, child-custody mediation, and letters of rebuttal
            or grievance dealing with matters of employment. Again, since I am not personally involved in the situation at
            hand, I seem to have a certain knack for creating wellorganized, logical letters that refrain from an emotional

            smoothly, your healthy business must proactively engage in relationships with formidable partners, co-workers,
            customers, and employees who you want to genuinely care about your success, and who you hope will maintain a
            sense of loyalty, trust, and even enthusiasm for supporting your goals. <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i> for businesses
            address the same dynamics commonly discovered within our inter-personal connections.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">For example, once I was asked by a famous international fine artist for my advice regarding a messy business matter
            he was having with his long-standing agent. After a thirty-year history with the same agent, this artist decided
            to branch out and try a new approach for promoting and selling his work with another agency that apparently had
            a bigger and more dynamic vision for showcasing his amazing original paintings, as well as expanding and monetizing
            his limited editions reproductions. However, once he issued the “walking papers” to his original agent, the artist
            was met with much more than a scowl. In fact, his agent was so offended and upset, that he vowed to tie up the
            “property” in court for years, withhold the artist’s royalties, and in essence, make</p>

        <p class="mb-10">him wish he had never tried to “cross” him! Wow! I thought … hmmm, this type of rhetoric certainly sounds like a
            rather nasty divorce.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In conversing with the artist, I asked what he had done so far to remedy the situation. The artist replied that he
            had already written a letter to the agent. “Oh, really. Have you sent it yet?” I inquired. He replied that he
            had not yet sent the <i>business letter</i>. I asked him to email a copy of his letter over to me. Once I had
            the chance to read the letter in question, I was relieved that it had not yet been issued. The proposed letter
            smacked of defensiveness, counter threats, and even an element of pleading with the original agent to be “reasonable”
            and allow him, as a former client, to be in charge of his life’s work and professional choices.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once again, I drew the analogy of a divorce. After all, the artist had been represented by the agent for a good thirty
            years! So from the agent’s perspective, “How dare he leave me and after all I’ve done for him!”</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After interviewing the artist further, I suggested that I re-write a letter that would be much more respectful, face-saving,
            and appreciative. Moreover, I rightfully included an element that conveyed, in essence, to the agent that while
            the artist may be “stepping out” and trying someone new, it certainly was not a guarantee that it would be a
            more</p>

        <p class="mb-10">profitable or better business relationship. Therefore, a much more compelling message, was to include such accolades
            as respect and appreciation, as well as a realistic request for leaving the door open, in the event of his possible
            return.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This seemed to go over quite well. The original agent, gracefully bowed out without further threat, while the artist
            pursued a new path for sharing his work with the world. In fact, he was so pleased with the outcome of the letter,
            the artist complimented me by sharing his business success with others on Linkedin, a social media site.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Whether it be the business of love, friendship, or commercial enterprises, unless you are a complete solo entrepreneur,
            a trust-fund baby, and/or have the luxury of not working at all; for most, the business connections we encounter
            or forge along the way are often quite necessary and can empower or disempower any goals we may dream of.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One instance comes to mind regarding a request for a cover letter for a woman seeking employment for a very lucrative

            an engaging personality. She was in her midforties and had been dealing with health challenges and marital issues

            intelligence. In essence, it was a great “closer” letter for selling herself. It turned out there were over three
            hundred applicants vying for this particular position. However, she was the very first applicant chosen to interview
            for the job. In fact, the prospective employer, (a plastic surgeon), commented that out of all the applicants,
            it was her very impressive letter that compelled him to meet with her first.</p>

            discuss our merits, be logical and fair, or simply put our best foot forward in order to claim a desired outcome,
            we sell ourselves short. Or, we may be so self-absorbed that what we personally write or express seems boastful,
            self-indulgent, or one-sided. Our insecurities regarding previous perceived</p>

        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, I had the unique opportunity to gift an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> to the talented winner of a short-story
            writer’s contest. After pondering what relationship matter she would like to address, the contest winner, Laura,
            graciously requested that I write a love letter from her soul, or her unconscious self, to Laura, her conscious,
            or aware self.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">If you the reader, agree that there is a purpose for our lives, that there is a personal and spiritual plan for our
            own soul’s evolution, then you will more easily grasp the meaning of this letter request. Laura had been going

            it can be like finding a family heirloom.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, I happened to meet a charming young woman, Violette, in her late twenties at a neighborhood charity event.
            Violette was a photographer for an upscale, local magazine. We shared a delightful conversation regarding the
            many social events she was called upon to attend as part of her growing career. Once she learned of my passion
            for writing the
            <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i>, Violette could not resist telling me of her own recent encounter with magical
            letters.</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Violette began by revealing her recent heart-breaking experience when her relationship with her boyfriend of six
            years had dissolved only a couple months prior. Yes, although Violette was ready to settle down and get married,
            her long-term boyfriend was just not quite as committed or ready to “tie the knot”. Violette sorrowfully lamented
            upon how much</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />
        <div class="mb-40">
            <p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
            <p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">563 &nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">
            she truly wanted to be married and start a family. She had such deep admiration for her own parents, for whom she considered
            to have such a wonderfully ideal marriage. Honestly, Violette was so impressed with the love, devotion, and romantic
            gestures expressed by her parents over the years; and in contrast to her own experience, she worried that perhaps
            it was not possible for her to ever find that kind of solid, loving, ideal relationship. What I found quite impressive
            though, was what Violette had to say next :</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">“I have been feeling so let down, after my boyfriend and I split up. And, I just wonder if it is even possible to
            find the kind of love my parents share, especially since so many of my friends have been disillusioned with their
            relationships. So, recently, I asked my mom to show me the letters! My mom was a bit surprised. She mentioned
            that she planned to show the letters after I got married.”</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I was so curious about these “letters” she wanted to see. Violette then explained:</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">“My parents have written love letters to one another since they were in college. I know they continue to give each
            other letters to this day. I was so sad over my situation, I begged my mother to let me see those letters!”</p>
        <p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Well according to Violette, her mother went upstairs and</p>
        <mbp:pagebreak />

        </div>
        <p class="mb-10">retrieved a large metal box from the closet. She brought the box down, and placed it on the dining room table. Violette
            spent the entire day with tears rolling down her cheeks, just reading the stack of beautiful letters her parents
            had shared with one another over more than thirty years! Violette mentioned she was completely moved by how her
            parents cherished one another and even despite certain difficulties or set-backs along the way, they had continued
            this tradition of sharing their hearts through these endearing love letters.</p>
