		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-40">HONORING OUR FRIENDS<br>AND<br>WHEN FRIENDSHIPS GET IN THE WAY</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Do you find yourself to be attractive? I am not referring to looking in the mirror. Rather, do you consider yourself to
			be the kind of person you would easily befriend? Forming and maintaining friendships is somewhat of a skill, yet it is
			a natural talent for those who consider themselves to be a wonderful friend already. In other words, if you would like
			to have a friend who is similar to you, bestowed with those certain</p>

		<div class="mb-40">

		</div>
		<p class="mb-20">
			ingratiating attributes that you already own and are difficult to ignore, then you most likely are a sought-after friend.
			You are a keeper.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">EXPLORING THE MEANING OF FRIENDSHIP</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">There is a universal need for feeling accepted by others. Most of us have experienced feeling lonely at one point or another.
			On those occasions, having a friend, a supportive connection with another can be so very comforting. As children, once
			we begin to socialize outside of our family circle, typically, we soon understand how to navigate our way through our
			attractions for desired entertainment, need for playmates, or otherwise satisfy our urge to fit in and feel part of the
			social milieu. Our friendships tend to further feed our sense of identity. Developmentally, if a child somehow fails to
			grasp how to successfully navigate the social terrain or awkwardly misses the “friendship boat”, they may tend to either
			socially withdraw or act out with their peers in more aggressive ways.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">SCARRED FOR LIFE</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Children are essentially egocentric. They initially tend to base their friendships on whether they really belong or are</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 426</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">accepted by their peers. Unfortunately, children can suffer life-long emotional scars when they have participated in any
			form of relational aggression during their formative years. These emotional imprints may stem from either being a bully,
			a target, or a bystander, which refers to someone who did not stand up for another kid who was being mistreated. This
			subject is so close to my heart due to my daughter’s horrific encounter with bullying when she was in middle school that
			I wrote the “Be Friendship Focused” children’s self-empowerment/anti-bullying program along with creating the “A-Z Power
			Cards”, which helps children to learn about what character or integrity really means.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As we mature, we grow to feel our friends not only support our values, interests, and social status, but they provide a
			safe space for revealing ourselves and our innermost feelings when we feel we have been mistreated, find ourselves feeling
			out of sync, or when we are filled with regret. We turn to our friends for emotional support and guidance. We seek our
			friends to share our interests and, at times, to fill a void, so we do not feel so alone.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Friendships can also enhance our memories. As we recall special moments in time or other lovely sentimental experiences,
			what about that collection of photos or the memorabilia we’ve saved over the years? If we do not have a</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">427 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">meaningful person such as a family member or a friend seen in that photo who shared the moment with us, well, it is just
			not as treasured.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">An important feature involving the concept of friendships is that our friends often tend to reflect back to us a sense
			of group identity, or we are, in a way, defined through our friendships, such as the adage: <i>Birds
				of a feather flock together</i>. In essence, we hang out with certain friends, since through our rapport, we can feel
			understood, or we just relate to one another based on common values, or shared interests. However, let’s face it; friendships
			do occur in matters of degrees.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">What qualifies as a true <i>BFF</i> or life-long friendship, just like any other meaningful relationship, is an underlying,
			undeniable sense of trust. While we may have a large social circle, replete with scads of acquaintances for whom we may
			refer to as our “friends,” real friendships are born on a much deeper, much more honest level that is developed with the
			investment of time and experience.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sometimes, our dearest friends show up in the strangest places. They appear out of the blue in uncanny, surprising ways
			and step forward to help us in our times of need. Other times, upon meeting someone, we are intuitively drawn to</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 428</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">become one another’s friend as there is an unspoken energetic affinity and connection. This lends a sense of belonging
			to the same tribe.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">As I look back on my life and muse over the most important alliances with others, I am struck by the knowingness that there
			was never a per chance meeting. Rather, our friendship connection emerged out of an urge to experience a certain life
			lesson or feel connected either directly or through our mutual sense of resonance and care.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">GENDER-MIXED PLATONIC FRIENDS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is quite common for gay men and any gender-preferenced woman to form an endearing friendship. In fact, this type of
			friendly mix can be quite fun and supportive. However, true platonic friendships between straight males and females is
			somewhat more unique. If there is a physical attraction by either party, then the friendship may be gratifying, yet somewhat
			stressful on some level. However, for those men and women who just <i>click</i> as good friends, their connection can
			be immensely rewarding.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A friend of mine, Trish, discussed one of her dearest and most treasured friendships with a fellow named Hank, who happened
			to be her next-door neighbor. They have known</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">429 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">one another for over ten years. Trish is quite convinced that Hank is an incarnated angel who was Divinely sent to her
			on a mission from Heaven. Hank has generously demonstrated such a pure and genuine kindness and care toward Trish and
			her family over the years that it would be difficult to list all the wonderful, supportive gifts he has brought to their
			lives.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In fact, Hank has performed so many random acts of kindness that Trish initially began wondering how she would ever be
			able to repay him. Since she felt so beholden to this man, she asked my advice. After some consideration, I suggested
			that she allow herself to, unequivocally, be a recipient of his kindness. Further, in a playful way, I advised her to
			make the following pronouncement to Hank:</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>Surely, Hank, I must have been an amazing friend of yours in a
				previous lifetime. In fact, I am quite certain I was so selflessly kind,
				generous, and supportive toward you that you absolutely must owe
				me in this lifetime! I am actually allowing you to return the favors
				and pay me back abundantly as my good karma has graced me to
				receive so many gifts from you.</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">My friend Trish followed my advice and quoted my verbal rhetoric verbatim. Thereby, she gave Hank complete carte blanche
			to be relentlessly good to her and her family as long as he is compelled to do so. Dear Hank’s immediate</p>

		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 430</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">response to her proclamation, <i>“Great… that works
				for me.”</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">You see, there is a gift found in giving to others that is uplifting and fulfilling. Actually, whether in a romantic, familial,
			or neighborly fashion, the act of kindness or being generous toward another, and knowing you have made a charitable or
			positive difference in their life, is quite gratifying. The gift received by giving to another can simply be enough. Sometimes,
			just accepting kindness in the spirit of friendship is another way of living in grace and promoting the cycle of giving
			and receiving. Truly unabashed, platonic friendship between men and women is like a rare jewel – less abundant, and quite
			exquisite.

		<h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">Donald’s Story</h3>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“TRUE BLUE FRIEND“</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I once wrote an inspired letter to be given from a young man, Donald, who had found true friendship with a woman, Patti,
			whom he had, once upon a time, briefly dated. While their initial encounter did not culminate in romance, they discovered
			a deep, mutual understanding and caring whereby they grew to rely upon the emotional support found</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">431 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">
			in the comfort of their trusted friendship. They were able to openly share about personal experiences and concerns and respected
			one another’s acceptance and/or guidance.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At one point, Patti had been experiencing some emotional difficulty with one of her family members. Donald wanted to emotionally
			lift her up and felt compelled to acknowledge Patti as well as his appreciation of their special connection through an
			<i>Inspired Heart Letter.</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I felt quite complimented to be asked to compose such an honorable letter and wonderful tribute to their friendship. Along
			with the letter, Donald personally picked each flower from a specialty florist shop and created an amazing bouquet, which
			accompanied the stylishly delivered
			<i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>. What a lovely gesture! The following is an excerpt from this sweet message:</p>

			<p class="mb-10"><i>It was wonderful to see you for lunch yesterday. As you know, your

			<p class="mb-10"><i>My hope for you, Patti, is that you fully understand how completely

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Another beautiful component to friendship is that we do not tend to hold our friends to the same standards as we would
			a romantic partner or life-mate. We are usually much more forgiving or allowing of strange habits, peccadilloes, or even
			eccentricity or weirdness, that we may tend to chalk up as being flamboyant, dramatic, awkward, shy, ungrounded, a bit
			serious, impulsive, grandiose… yah-be-de-yah-be-de-yah… all the while exclaiming upon and defending their endearing attributes
			such as sweet-natured, kind, great sense of humor, talented, generous, wise, sensitive, astute intelligence, creative,
			fun, reliable, thoughtful, etc.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">I may not be part of the norm, but I do enjoy having a colorful array of friends. Like any other relationship though, true
			friendship is formed over time with tender loving care, sincerity, acceptance, forgiveness, honesty, and, of course, plenty
			of laughter and good memories.</p>


		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">GIVE AND TAKE</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Generosity is a key component for authentic friendships. However, it is a different brand of generosity opposed to the
			type of selfless giving that may be called upon for enduring romance, marriage, parenting, and other family matters. In
			friendship, there is less of a personal agenda. Friends can be a</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">435 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">bit more objective when peeking into one another’s lives and offering their support.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">A true friend has nothing more to gain than the sense of affinity and connection, based upon mutual understanding and caring.
			There are no romantic or family entanglements to move through or protect. Often, our friends vicariously experience our
			joy or pain with no personal agenda aside from their desire to be a good friend and to wish us well.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I recently had a conversation with a wise friend who is looking forward to starting her life anew with her new fiancé,
			after experiencing a divorce and raising her two children. She and her hubby-to-be recently returned from an amazing vacation,
			including a first-class European cruise and trip to Dubai. Their vacation lasted nearly a month. With real gladness over
			how well they got along given the amount of time spent with each other, she reported that now, more than ever, she knew
			they could endure a longer-term, uninterrupted lifetime together with ease and flow.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">You see, most important to her was how special it was to not only travel together, but to spend so much constant time exclusively
			with one another while remaining harmoniously connected.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 436</p>
		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Laughingly, she commented how, sometimes, even when traveling with a platonic friend, there can be friction. For this lady,
			the friendship quality of their experience while traveling – and within their relationship as a whole – was at least as
			important and gratifying as their romantic liaison. At the close of their vacation, she asked her beloved what he considered
			to be the most wonderful part of their extravagant travel experience. Without hesitation, he replied, <i>“Spending quality time with
				my partner.”</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">As a world traveler myself, I can attest that there is nothing compared to experiencing new cultures, new landscapes, and
			the sheer joy of discovery found in traveling with a positive, flexible, fun-loving companion. The more salient message
			her fiancé conveyed was the value of experiencing friendship within the context of a supportive partnership and simply
			enjoying time together without an agenda. So, being married to your best friend is the happiest place to be on earth;
			besides, whom else would you consider marrying?</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">THE INVESTMENT OF FRIENDSHIP IN A LYRICAL WAY</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As you may have guessed by now, another passion of mine besides ghostwriting the <i>Inspired Heart Letters</i>, is music.
			In particular, I enjoy singing. Actually, I was a</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">437 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">perpetual shower singer before I began public speaking. On the scary meter, it has been said that public speaking ranks
			as the most daring act, often out-weighing <i>bungee-chord</i> jumping, parachuting, and cliff diving. For most, dynamic
			public speaking is an acquired skill that calls for really letting go, steeling your nerves, and stepping way outside
			of your self-conscious comfort zone. Singing in public raises the bar another notch and places you in another dimension
			of courage that surpasses all the rest.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At one point, several years ago, I decided to take a singing class. I figured that if I could sing on stage, then surely
			my public speaking skills would be enhanced. Well, once this pony left the gate, there was no stopping it. It was frightening
			and exhilarating, and did I mention… great fun?</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After a few months of classes and a couple of song-recitals later, I happened to meet a popular local band leader and lead
			guitarist. Not only did he encourage my singing, but within a couple months, I found myself singing with his R & B band
			as a regular “special guest vocalist.”</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The band leader and I developed a wonderful, platonic friendship. He possessed an uncanny sense of humor, and often asked
			for my professional advice regarding his dating or relationship matters. Being the word smith that I am, it was not long
			before I began writing song lyrics. My band leader</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">KEEPING IT REAL</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The saying, <i>A friend in need is a friend indeed</i> translates to the idea that acceptance and support, blended with
			a true sense of honesty, while having each other’s best interests at heart, is undeniably important for real friendship
			to be felt. However, absolute honesty must be conveyed with sensitivity. Without enough sensitivity and compassion, just
			like any other relationship, it can backfire. Just like all other meaningful relationships, there is a genuine investment
			of time, caring, and respect called for before the friendship can deepen and solidify into an everlasting, sincere foundation
			of trust. Referring to friendships, I believe that is how the philosophical thought regarding <i>quality versus quantity</i>			was realized</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sometimes, although we grow apart from what initially brought us together – whether it might be a mutual interest or life
			experience, predicament, or passage – we may find that we no longer relate to our friends in the same way, as our lives
			transform and evolve over time. Still, our long-term friends shared our history and bore witness to our own life transitions.
			These time-honored connections we have built remain so dear to us simply based on our mutual history and experiences as
			well as our true knowing and acceptance of</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">441 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">one another.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">That level of friendship may even be more deeply honest than how we are known by our parents, siblings, even our spouse
			or children. To feel known, or understood by others, is truly a blessing. Our long-term true friends were there perhaps
			before our current life circumstance. They knew us when we were younger or in a previous stage of life. They have seen
			us through the road of life while continuing, unconditionally, to love and accept us, no matter what. I am personally
			quite blessed to have several enduring, valued friendships.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I contend that part of my friendship success is due to a lack of measurement for the give and take involved. It is an unquantifiable
			flow of love, acceptance, allowance, and concern. A balanced connection is experienced over time. For instance, there
			may be times when you rely upon the support of a friend, whereas, other times, the same friend sought your advice or help.
			Friends more easily forgive one another. A real friend does not usually freak-out if something important arises and you
			have to cancel your time together. If you call them late at night when you are feeling emotionally needy, they pick up
			the phone. Genuine friendship is based on caring, interest, and concern for one another.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">You may have friends who are geographically distant</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

		<p class="mb-10">or have family or work obligations that interfere with spending regular time together. In that case, it is always reassuring
			that despite the distance or time apart, when you do connect, it is as though there was no lapse in time. You can simply
			take up where you left off and are just grateful for an opportunity to share. There is a simple, underlying understanding.
			The role of friendship is to stand by and support one another across all circumstances, whether in celebration or in times
			of need.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Yes, while true friends unconditionally stand by one another and do not abandon each other no matter what, they may not
			always approve of a friend’s decisions or actions. In reality, <i>standing</i> by means that a real friend will support
			their friend’s best interests, even if that calls for being bluntly honest, simply disagreeing with their perspective,
			discouraging them from making a mistake, and giving practical advice. In those moments, a real friend will encourage you
			to stand in your power and experience more success even when a situation calls for courage or sacrifice.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Anyone can get lost in the land of assumptions, for example, when you encounter a situation that disappoints you, or if
			someone says something to you that you interpret as negative. With true friends, you can easily give honest</p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">feedback and seek clarifications for your feelings in order to clear up misunderstandings. This level of deeply honest,
			open communication is earned and enjoyed over the test of time. Therefore, it stands to reason that you must choose your
			friends wisely.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I would be lying if I said no friendship ever encounters any difficulty or unsavory rifts; however, friendships that are
			built upon a deeper understanding and sense of trust do eventually spring back or withstand the emotional upheaval, often
			reinforcing the friendship after a good cry or hearty laugh. It is important to own your mistakes, or to freely come forward
			with clear issues or questions concerning your friendship. Be willing to openly share any thoughts or feelings that feel
			out of alignment with your friendship experience. Like any other relationship, it is unwise to ignore or minimize issues
			that question the integrity of your connections with others.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Maintaining healthy boundaries with balanced friendships is essential for positive life experiences. Let go of “fake friends”
			or those that continue to violate your trust, have an alternative agenda that is more selfserving than mutually supportive,
			or who perpetuate a negative power struggle with you. A toxic friendship may not readily be noticed, but once it has surfaced,
			do yourself a favor and exit stage left. This is the</p>

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 444</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">type of negative drama to avoid at all cost. Let go of any resentments as well. Instead, be the wiser for the encounter.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As social beings, we all have superficial friendships or associations. These include people whom you may socialize with,
			or engage with in your work environment, school, church, social clubs, or other mutual areas of interest, yet they are
			not necessarily individuals whom you have developed that bond of trust you can openly confide in.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Remember the saying, <i>Water seeks its own level</i>. The quality of your friendships may reflect back to you your own
			level of transparency or willingness to be vulnerable. Moreover, in order to form true friendships with others, it is
			important to be open or present to having that experience. Be outwardly and genuinely interested, reach out to others,
			be less egocentric, and have a positive demeanor.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">By becoming more involved and socially available, whether through clubs, charities, sports, art, music, educational pursuits,
			or trying out something altogether new like a sailing class, yoga retreat, or any Meet-Up experience, your chances of
			widening your social circle and building new friendships will most likely be enhanced.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">MALE VERSUS FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When it comes to true blue friendships, often there are apparent differences between same-gender male and female relationships.
			The male perspective for friendships, as I have come to understand, just as all real friendships, are built over time.
			Perhaps it is true, in general, friendships between males are comparatively less judgmental than friendships between females.
			Friendships between males are seemingly less complicated, less interpersonal, and more rudimentary. Men can vacillate
			between their interpersonal and basic needs. While men may need a dose of interpersonal relating or desire to connect
			in a more authentic way from time to time as problems arise, they also tend to disconnect once the problem is solved.
			What is important to most men is simply how they view the other person and whether they enjoy spending time together as
			buddies.
		</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Initially, when making superficial social contacts, and possibly forming new friendships, men tend to experience <i>shoulder-to-shoulder</i>			connections, whereas women usually have <i>face-to-face</i> girlfriend experiences. Women are usually quite comfortable
			facing one another over coffee and direct conversations with fewer distractions; there is no goal other than to catch
			up or discuss their lives exploring both the</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 446</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">emotional and physical realms. Men, however, are not usually seeking friendships to explore their personal issues or interests;
			instead men generally maintain a more aloof or superficial rapport. As an example, at dinner parties or social engagements,
			it seems that a man, more often, identifies himself or expresses an interest to his male counterparts by discussing how
			each makes a living, whether he made a profit on his last investment, who won the last football game, perhaps where one
			or the other enjoys playing golf, tennis, or likes to surf.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It appears the male interest starts off with exploring and relating to the human <i>doing</i>-ness rather than the <i>being</i>-ness
			of life when forming new alliances that possibly lead to friendships. In other words, males tend to define themselves
			and assess one another on their measure of social status by what they each have accomplished.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I am told that men are usually more comfortable interacting with their male friends in planned events, such as getting
			together in order to socialize or compete through structured activities. Conversely, women seek connections with other
			women with a tendency to evaluate each other on a variety of levels. They often assess each other’s outward appearance
			and sense of style; social status, such as <i>married,</i></p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> <i> single, divorced,</i> or
			<i>widowed;</i> and whether they <i>feel</i> a sense of safety and trust with one another</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Female friendships may be considered more multi-dimensional, such as offering support to one another for every emotional
			encounter. From a wide array of interpersonal relationship issues, women do seem to have more intimate communications.
			They will talk endlessly, recharging their cell phones during conversation while helping one another to analyze and problem
			solve. They will offer solace when there is a relationship breakup or other challenge. Girlfriends will often rally around
			one friend undergoing a crisis perhaps by hosting a pajama party whereby they stay up until the wee hours listening to
			emotional ranting or venting, all the while supporting their friend through the thick and thin of life’s treasures and
			travails.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">While women cry upon each other’s shoulders, traditionally, men tend to shoulder their emotional pain through actions.
			Perhaps with a
			<i>stiff upper lip</i>, men are driven to just deal with life as it shows up</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I see that men are evolving, however, and more men are opening up toward being more emotionally vulnerable and balanced
			when expressing their thoughts and feelings with friends. You can google an onslaught of men’s groups in your community.
			Many of these are support groups that deal</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 448</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">with an array of social/emotional challenges. These male-oriented support groups are becoming vastly popular. I once led
			a men’s support group entitled, “Burst Your Own Bubble.” This group of men had been meeting regularly for over seven years.
			They formed a very tightly knit bond whereby their meetings were considered a sort of escape valve, or a place where they
			could openly discuss their most personal issues seeking the wisdom and support of their fellow brothers. At one point,
			they felt it would be an asset to have a female perspective. Thereby, they sought my guidance. I represented the <i>Yin</i>			to their <i>Yang</i>. This was a rich experience for me as I found this particular group to be quite forthcoming and realistic
			in their approach for identifying feelings and problem solving.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Other group encounters can form solid friendships that can last a lifetime, regardless of gender. These are often developed
			through team efforts or common goals. When the goals include danger, risk, or exerted mutual efforts for a common cause,
			the group identity is often profound. There is a wonderful camaraderie in groups, such as among war veterans, firemen
			and policemen, a scientific expedition, volunteers for search and rescue efforts, survivors of natural disasters, any
			type of sport team, and the list goes on. It</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“CLEANING OUT THE CLOSET”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I once knew a woman, Lydia, who was a real clean freak. In fact, as a sideline, she advertised her service for being a
			“Professional Closet Organizer.” She preferred everything that was outmoded or unused to be recycled or discarded altogether.
			She was the antithesis of the <i>pack rat</i>. Moreover, she did not like having any aspect of her life to be considered
			undefined, unresolved, or well… cluttered.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At times, she deeply agonized over challenges or disputes within her romantic relationships or disappointments regarding
			the behaviors of family members, issues with her neighbors, and any other perceived problem that she considered out of
			alignment with how she believed it should be. Lydia kept an impeccable appearance, enjoyed daily exercise routines, and
			was devoutly religious.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As an observer, it seemed that her sense of order and</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 450</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">routine supported a fundamental sense of safety or certainty, whereby I came to learn she was actually internally battling
			messy emotional issues that were kept at bay with regular doses of mood-altering medication.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At one point, Lydia decided to create a better sense of order in her life by addressing certain disappointing or unfinished
			relationship matters and cleaning up any attached or unsettled emotional debris. She was aware that she still hung onto
			past situations that had preyed upon her heart and which she felt needed to finally be released. Consequently, Lydia called
			me to write an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> regarding an old friendship that dissolved in a mysterious way.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Lydia previously had a very close female friendship with Kerry lasting over five years. The two ladies enjoyed a mutually
			supportive and positive rapport with tons of beach walks, Sunday brunches, and hosting gourmet dinner parties together.
			They spent time with one another while viewing independent films, visiting museums, double dating, shopping, and even
			celebrating certain holidays together.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At one point, Lydia met a wealthy widower and soon, after a rather brief period of dating, they married. Actually, she
			was introduced to her husband by her dear friend, Kerry. Unfortunately, their marriage was doomed from the start.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">451 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">It seems that they were unable to consummate their marriage with any satisfaction. Lydia felt tremendously confused and
			unable to cope with her muddled marriage situation effectively.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Apparently, she could not control her growing resentment for her husband and their lack of a satisfying physical love life.
			Within a year, the couple had their marriage annulled. Lydia found herself in another cluttered and confusing relationship
			soon after. This time, she became involved with a man who was not only financially struggling, but was a single father
			with two young children. And, according to Lydia, what a mess that turned out to be!</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Returning to the unsettled friendship or falling out with Kerry, it seems that once she divorced her husband, her friend,
			Kerry, also left the scene. She quit returning Lydia’s phone calls and would not respond to her emails. Lydia felt as
			though she had been “dropped like a hot potato” when she actually needed the emotional support from her friend.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One might surmise that perhaps Kerry felt that Lydia was out of integrity regarding her treatment of her husband; or she
			thought Lydia did not work hard enough to repair or heal their marital difficulties. Whatever the case may be, Lydia continued
			to struggle with her disenfranchised friendship and grew to consider it as part of her hidden, yet unresolved,

		<p class="mb-10">emotional baggage.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When she asked me to write an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> to her longlost friend, Kerry, Lydia’s goal was to clean up
			any misgivings and to clear out the obviously untidy, outworn friendship with a better sense of closure. Yes, she wanted

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Interestingly, Lydia is the only client, so far, who wanted the closing contents of her letter changed in a rather peculiar

			well almost perfect. Her one and only concern was that near the close of the original letter, it seemed that her old friend,
			Kerry, may be inspired to contact her. My response to Lydia was to explain that the latter part of the initial letter
			was written with that very intention. I truly felt she would welcome the opportunity to hear from her old friend. However,
			Lydia insisted that she only wanted to clean matters up and move on. She emphatically insisted she had no compunction
			or desire to ever engage with Kerry again. With that, I re-wrote the close of her letter in such a way that it sealed
			their history and certainly discouraged any invitation to regain their friendship or even have a conversation regarding
			their falling out.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">After a few months had passed, I heard from Lydia again on another letter matter. During our conversation, she happened
			to mention with considerable dismay that she had never heard a response to the <i>Inspired
				Heart Letter</i> she had commissioned me to write to her old friend, Kerry. What can I say? At times, it feels like I
			<i>keep writing the books and
				they tear out the pages</i>. In other words, I intuitively knew her heart’s intention, yet, it seems she had a tendency
			to be an emotional hoarder. Ultimately, her ego’s defensiveness got in the way.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">DRAWING THE LINE ON FRIENDSHIP</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I helped a lovely couple from Australia, Katrina and Dennis, by writing an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> to one of their
			friends, Tiffany, who seemed quite unaware of her intrusiveness, or how she often took on the role of being the third
			wheel encroaching on this married couple’s lifestyle.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">To lend a bit of history, this couple first met through Katrina’s mother during her visit to the Hawaiian Islands while
			she was there to see her sons who were famous surfers. She met their surfing buddy, Dennis, from Australia, and her mother
			astutely mentioned that he should meet her daughter, Katrina, as she was sure he would absolutely fall in love with her.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Well, they did meet, per chance, soon after, when Katrina was nearly finished with high school, and Dennis happened to
			visit the California coast on another surfing expedition. They had an amicable meeting and he left a week or so later
			to return to Australia.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Twenty years later, Dennis happened to travel to Los Angeles again for a job interview and while he was there, he looked
			up his old surfing buddies, Katrina’s brothers. They mentioned Katrina had never married and had recently returned to
			the Los Angeles area, after working in New York

		<p class="mb-10">for several years. Dennis had never married either as he had other family obligations in Australia. Well, the couple did
			re-meet after two decades of separation and felt an instant and powerful attraction. Two months later, Dennis sent Katrina
			a plane ticket to visit him in Australia. She returned from down-under as an engaged woman, and they were married shortly
			thereafter. Yes, all those years later, and Katrina has been happily living the life of an Aussie with her loving hubby
			Dennis.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Regarding the intrusive Tiffany, she was not an intentional interloper nor was she a difficult or negative person. She
			was just clingy, rather obtuse, and perhaps lonely. Katrina and Dennis are very kindhearted, caring people. They did not
			wish to offend their friend. However, they relished their time together as a couple, and their patience for sharing so
			much of their time with Tiffany was beginning to wear thin.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Apparently, Tiffany invited herself, or stopped by uninvited, to their home nearly on a daily basis. Dennis and Katrina
			were always gracious, although often they privately felt a bit indignant toward this awkwardly unaware friend. Through
			my suggested <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> for enlightening her, they were able to send Tiffany a message that expressed

		<p class="mb-20">their position as well as acknowledge the wholesome parts of their friendship. At the same time, Katrina and Dennis laid
			down the prerequisite behaviors for sharing time together with her. This couple was very grateful for my letter-writing
			intervention and, later on, reported that the issue was easily resolved with a better sense of mutual respect and awareness.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">VIRTUAL FRIENDSHIP</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">With all of the current social media at play, I must comment regarding virtual versus actual friendships. One cannot fully
			realize the value of friendship solely based on internet introductions. There is so much to be gained for growing friendships
			through actual, real-life encounters and shared experiences. It is sad when I hear people boast of having so many online
			friends whom they have never actually met in person. There is a great deal of manipulation that can occur; it is far too
			easy to create a pretend life experience, or hide behind your true feelings and identity, as opposed to getting out there
			and mingling with real people and finding your tribe.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Get out of the safety zone and live in the reality zone. Besides, no matter what might be said or revealed, one cannot

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once there were two friends, Lilly and Joyce, who had grown up together in a small town, in rural Iowa. They met in the
			second grade and grew to be inseparable best friends all the way through high school and beyond. The two had shared so
			many life experiences growing up, from playing with Barbie dolls and joining Girl Scouts, to becoming high school cheerleaders
			and models for the local department stores. They spent endless hours fantasizing about how their lives would turn out.
			Yes, they were both quite lovely, beautiful young ladies.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">They shared their dreams of becoming well-paid, celebrated fashion models, marrying handsome men, and having exactly two
			adorable children. Of course, they planned to declare each other as the godmother to each other’s children. The two friends
			relied upon one another for emotional support and assumed they would be a part of each other’s life forever. After high
			school, both young ladies desperately wished to move to either New York or Los Angeles and get away from the humdrum
			predictable, small-town existence that seemed to entrap so many of their peers.</p>

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The two friends knew that by sticking together they could more easily fly away and discover a whole new and exciting destiny.
			Lilly had an aunt and uncle who happened to live in Queens, New York. Joyce and Lilly agreed that instead of applying
			to college, their best bet was to move to New York and find some type of work while attending modeling school. Lilly’s
			aunt and uncle agreed to let the girls live in their spare room for up to three months while they looked for work If they
			wished to stay in New York beyond that, Lilly’s aunt and uncle would charge them reasonable rent.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">And so it was. Lilly and Joyce took off on their grand adventure. Their parents each provided enough money for their daughters
			to attend a rather prestigious modeling school. They were proud of their daughters, and at the very least, agreed that
			by giving them this “once in a lifetime” opportunity, if the girls failed, they could always return home and make other
			plans.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The condensed version of this story goes like this. Lilly and Joyce each found employment. Initially, Lilly worked in a
			bookstore, and Joyce worked at Nordstrom’s cosmetics counter. Lilly stayed and worked overtime whenever the bookstore
			hosted an event for book signings or lectures. She actually found herself soaking up the knowledge and enjoying the</p>

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">461 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">social rapport that went along with these events. Over time, she found herself participating in book clubs, attending poetry
			recitals, and even joining a “New Writers” workshop. On the other hand, Joyce found herself filling endless hours applying
			makeup on aging New York housewives, and working as a makeup artist for a variety of events from bridal showers, college
			graduations, weddings, and anniversaries, to in-house fashion events. These young ladies tried out for numerous modeling
			opportunities. The competition was fierce.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Lilly was fortunate at the time. Not only was she hired to model for a prestigious fashion magazine, but she met the man
			of her dreams, a very successful, dedicated author, at a book signing she attended. The couple married within a year.
			Of course, Joyce was her Maid of Honor. Three years later, Lilly gave birth to their daughter, Brianna. Then, two years
			after that, their other daughter, Jocelyn, was born.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Joyce, however, was having a different life experience, not exactly what she had originally planned. Joyce procured a limited
			number of printad modeling jobs. Further, through her work experience at Nordstrom’s, she had been hired from time to
			time to model at storewide fashion events. However, she never landed the type of fashion career she originally dreamed
			of. Her love life was less than satisfactory as well.</p>

		<p class="mb-10">She just never seemed to connect with a man who felt altogether right for her. Lilly and Joyce remained dear friends, but
			Joyce felt somewhat disenfranchised, or out of rhythm, with Lilly and her lifestyle.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After years of struggling to make it in New York City, Joyce still could not bring herself to return to her humble roots
			in Iowa. However, she intuitively knew that she needed to make a radical change in her life and try something new. She
			decided to try her luck by moving to the West Coast. Joyce thought Lilly would surely understand that she needed to move
			on in her life. However, surprisingly, Lilly must have been shocked and somewhat let down at the thought of her long-time
			friend moving so far away</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Instead of feeling understood, Joyce got the impression that Lilly, in essence, “cut her off.” Joyce recalled Lilly’s reaction
			to the news that Joyce was flying to the West Coast as being indifferent, if not chastising. According to Joyce, Lilly
			said:

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>Well, Joyce, I helped you all I could. My aunt and uncle were kind

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Joyce felt unsupported, if not abandoned, by her best friend. However, she was growing tired of feeling like the fifth
			wheel when she got together with Lilly and her growing family. Although Lilly tried several times to introduce her to
			her husband’s eligible bachelor friends, it just never worked out. Besides, her job at the department store was starting
			to feel like a real burn out. Those endless hours standing in high heels at the makeup counter were becoming unbearable.
			Every day, as time moved on, Joyce was growing past the prime age for being discovered and finally making it big in the
			modeling world. It felt like her life was collapsing and that she was not living her own life, but someone else’s. Joyce
			had no choice but to let go of her girlhood dreams, try to find her own way, and venture forth into unknown territory.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After relocating to Los Angeles, Joyce struggled for a few years, working at various jobs in sales and marketing. Finally,
			she decided to expand her education in the growing field of arts and technology. Joyce ended up at the Brook Institute
			for Photography. In short, she finally found her niche and became an established videographer. She even worked on a few
			fashion shows. Joyce’s life seemed to open up in new and gratifying ways.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When Joyce met me, she spoke of how her life had taken some “dog-leg turns”, and in spite of all the many disappointments
			life in New York left her with, she was proud of her growing accomplishments in LA. Regarding her friendship with Lilly,
			Joyce felt they no longer fit into each other’s world. It was as if they lived on two separate planets. Lilly was busy
			raising her kids and going on book tours with her husband. Their social circle was comprised mostly of other married couples
			and their families.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Still, Joyce admitted she really missed having the closeness, the shared history, and the sisterhood she had felt with
			Lilly in the past. She was grateful since Lilly had recently called her leaving a voice message announcing she was expecting
			a baby boy. However, although the message sounded friendly, it did not seem terribly warm or engaging. Joyce thought it
			sounded somewhat stiff, or formal, as though she was just part of a list of numbers to call. It really bothered Joyce;
			she felt so sad that their connection had dwindled. After hearing of my letter-writing service, Joyce asked me to write
			an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> to Lilly in hopes of regaining their special bond of friendship.</p>

			<p class="mb-10"><i>It was great hearing from you last week; thanks for your call. I am

			<p class="mb-10"><i>How fortunate you are. It seems that you have lived out what the two
					of us only dreamed of: a career in modeling, marrying the handsome
					guy, and being blessed with beautiful children. It took quite a lot for
					me to let go of a part of that dream. I spent so much time just trying
					to find my path. To be honest, Lilly, it was not always easy for me to

			<p class="mb-10"><i>I am beginning to understand that certain sense of clarity and ease with

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Soon after sending this letter, Joyce received a call from Lilly. This phone conversation was more than two hours. It was
			just a bit of catching up and a great deal of clearing up the misgivings over the last few years. Joyce was somewhat surprised
			that Lilly remarked, in retrospect, upon her feelings of sadness for her friend’s struggles, if not guilt, regarding how
			easily her own life had turned out in comparison.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">At the time, Lilly did not realize just how painful it was</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">469 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">for her dearest friend, Joyce, to encounter so much disappointment in New York while on her own. Further, Lilly could not
			fathom how Joyce could drastically move across country with no definite plan. In a way, Lilly admired Joyce’s bravery
			and independence. While Lilly’s life now seemed somewhat safe or predictable, she recalled the sweet sense of adventure
			that spurred the two friends to move to New York City to begin with.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Although their lives seemed, at this time, to contrast, the friends reveled in their special connection and enduring friendship
			through familiarity, developmental history, life passages, and shared values. Joyce soon became godmother, once again,
			to Lilly’s son, Cameron.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">More often than we may like to admit, our dear friends may actually feel more like our true family than the family we were
			born into. Those of us who do not enjoy deep connections with our immediate family of origin would probably never consciously
			select any of them to be our mother, father, brother or sister. Actually, in those instances, individuals are drawn to
			more deeply loving <i>family-like</i> connections with others through outer-world experiences. It feels to me that our
			soul ultimately decides who we decide to call family and hone our sense of identity from. However, as we grow up,</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 470</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">we may eventually feel more understood, nurtured, and even accepted, or respected, by our friends, or those special individuals
			who are connected to us through our hearts and not necessarily through bloodlines.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">Hypothetically, while some people are incredibly lucky to be nurtured and raised within healthy families, for those who
			did not experience a particularly warm fuzzy, nurturing home-life, there is a different soul contract or expression, a
			different destiny, that perhaps encourages one to leave the family nest early and look for more loving, wholesome connections
			with others out in the world where they can connect on a deeper level rather than conveniently relying upon the consistently
			dependable genetic family roots.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">FEARLESS FRIENDSHIPS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">What do you do when you see your friend is overwhelmed or is acting in harmful, self-destructive ways, or you have knowledge
			that they are somehow being duped or disrespected? True friends will step in and try to do the right thing, even though
			they may run the risk of anger or rejection from the friend they are actually trying to protect.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Years ago, when my daughter was quite young, and I had been studying rigorously in order to pass the licensure exams</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">KRISTINE GRANT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">471 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">for becoming a family therapist. I will never forget my dear friends, Kim and Maureen, who not only surprised me, but actually
			rescued me from feeling so wrung out, tired, and consumed with stress and responsibility. Without my prior knowledge,
			one day right after sitting for my board exams, my friends arrived at my home, popped me into the car, and we all drove
			to a relaxing resort south of the border. They had planned this for weeks, even my husband was in on this.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">What a delightful surprise! Everything, including childcare was pre-arranged by these dear friends. I slept the whole way
			there. It was transformational to just sleep on the beach, laugh, get a massage, and have our girl-time to totally unwind.
			Yes, it was wonderful to feel nurtured and cared for in such a supportive way. While I would not purposely have taken
			the time out for me, my friends cared enough to step in and support my need for a well-earned rest and relaxing time out.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">BEING THE BEARER OF BAD TIDINGS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">There are times true friends run the risk of receiving negative emotional backlash when they confront a friend regarding
			difficult or even terrible matters. It takes a great deal</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 472</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">of love and devotion to confront a friend with the truth, especially when there is much at stake. Personally, for example,
			I have known women whose friends chose not to alert them when they knew about their cheating spouse. In other similar
			instances, friends that knew about a spouse’s infidelity and informed their friend were often contradicted or pushed away,
			at least initially, while the friend worked through their shock or denial.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"> Nevertheless, when friends do decide not to reveal this type of critical information, then once it is discovered and is
			out in the open, there is a great deal of anger toward those friends that chose to withhold their prior knowledge. It
			may feel like a <i>damned if you do and damned
				if you don’t</i> predicament. However, just step into your friend’s shoes – if there was a dishonest situation that was
			happening to you behind your back – then decide whether or not you would want to know the truth.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">By sharing the truth, you do not have to lay judgment or give any unsolicited advice on how your friend should deal with
			the information. However, you can let your friend know you are there for them should they need to talk. You are open to
			listen and offer your insights or advice only if asked. Butting in to your friend’s life should not be your intention.
			Yet alerting them to known, verified information or even to</p>

		<p class="mb-20">inform them about local gossip when it may be damaging is being responsible.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">RESCUING FRIENDS</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When friends are acting in self-destructive ways or living an unhealthy lifestyle in one way or another, I feel as a friend,
			you are obligated to bring the situation to light and offer to help in any way you realistically can. This also can be
			tricky, as often people are in denial and they can construe a friend’s care as being meddlesome or judgmental. So tread
			carefully, but be honest. You are not there to fix anyone as that is most likely beyond your capabilities. Although through
			love and concern, you can guide your friend to acknowledge the problem, get the right help, or find the answers.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">As far as being a good friend to another, ask yourself whether you would want someone <i>just like you</i> to be your own
			friend. Consider the following concept: <i>Be Friendship Focused, Be a Friend First.</i></p>
