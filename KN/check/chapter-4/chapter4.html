		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">TANGLED KNOTS: MARITAL CONFLICTS </br>
			LETTERS TO A SPOUSE</h4>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">When love leads to marriage, the challenge is staying in love throughout the various stages of life. I often thought that
			the symbolism of the bride’s veil is such that after the initial courtship is over, or once the knot is tied and the veil
			has been lifted, the new Mister and Misses must face life’s challenges together. For some, losing the zest for the notion
			of “happily ever after” can be rather devastating.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">I contend that as humans, our relationships are our best</p>

			teachers, since we have unique opportunities to learn deeply about ourselves from matters of the heart. This is quite true
			within the logistics of marriage. The binding marital commitment, or the promise to love and to hold… no matter what,
			creates the opportunity to cherish the marriage as a unique entity. What the couple builds together is fundamental, or
			even more important than individual, separate desires.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">I can consider no better analogy than a garden. Marriages that flourish must be planted with loving intentions that can
			only take root, grow, and blossom with plenty of care and attention. Trust is the compost, the enriched soil, from which
			all else grows. When the trust is broken for whatever reason, it weakens the allegiance toward one another. Guilt, shame,
			and resentment are emotional states that disguise the underlying fear that may tarnish the sanctity of the relationship.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">If you are single and looking to find true love, and perhaps marriage, you can attract your soul mate for a healthy relationship
			by showing up with integrity, honor, and consideration. More than that, you magnetize love from another by being authentic,
			taking good care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually, and speaking your truth with kindness, while living
			in gratitude and appreciation. These elements must also be enlivened and contained in the</p>

		<p class="mb-10">ongoing marital experience. Moreover, couples who support one another during times of stress actually strengthen their
			bond.
		</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">Sometimes, we can lose sight of ourselves and of the bigger picture, which is the marriage itself. When this occurs, we
			may not be as attractive to one another. The marriage may become more fragile, undernourished, or starved for love and
			affection. And, one spouse alone cannot maintain a marriage, as this is definitely a joint effort.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">There is something to be said for those who take the plunge with all the ideal enthusiasm of a romantic and for those who
			maintain the honor and diligence attributed to sound partnerships. More often, those individuals or couples who do “the
			work” lovingly and consciously, evolve over time. Couples are in the unique situation to mirror back to one another that
			which is loving and wholesome or that which is in need of emotional/psychic repair.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">Our personal foundation, of course, is heavily influenced by our parents and early childhood experiences. Our ability to
			give and receive love is in direct alignment with how open we are to being in our true nature without learned negative
			coping skills, or other self-preserving defense mechanisms. For example, a child who experiences emotional rejection

		<p class="mb-10">from parent(s) or caretakers may emotionally shut down or insulate him or herself from feeling safe enough to be open and
			vulnerable. This individual may develop a personality style that may be manipulative, self-centered, or inevitably pushes
			love away</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">When someone is emotionally armored, then the possibility for intimacy is greatly diminished. And, whereas, <i>water seeks its own level,</i>			there tends to be a magnetic force attracting another who also struggles with intimacy, although usually expressed in
			a different way. For example, narcissistic personality types often find themselves in a relationship with a co-dependent
			personality. Ostensibly, it seems that they may each be getting their needs met. The narcissist may act in self-absorbed,
			self-gratifying ways that attract the co-dependent who minimizes his or her own innate need for love through feelings
			of unworthiness and focuses on catering to the whims of the narcissist. However, these personality types never truly feel
			safe to be in an authentic loving relationship. They are unwilling to let their emotional defenses down. Moreover, they
			do not enjoy the sense of personal freedom that comes with having a loving relationship toward their own self, let alone
			with another.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">Sometimes couples find themselves in such unhealthy and predictable patterns that it can be difficult to finally shut</p>

			brought them together in the first place). Yet, even if the sexual chemistry is off the charts, eventually the reality
			of irreconcilable differences or grievances may outweigh the allure. Then they might even find themselves waiting for
			the final curtain, or that deal-breaking transgression that will finally cause them to shift and exit stage-left. Here
			is a song I wrote related to that theme:</p>

		<h3 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-10">Suzanne’s Story</h3>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“WAKE-UP CALL”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">The following letter proved to be no less than an act of Divine intervention for Suzanne, a lovely and stunningly beautiful
			woman, with a gentle spirit. Suzanne had given up so many of life’s opportunities while trapped in a dysfunctional marriage
			bereft of the type of love and supportive caring that her soul craved. Suzanne described her husband, David, as being
			an unyielding perfectionist. No matter how much she tried to be the most perfect wife in every way, David somehow always
			made her feel wrong and as though she was just not good enough. He was often critical, belittling</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">191 &nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">and seemed indifferent to her need to feel accepted and cherished.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">Whenever Suzanne tried to talk to her husband, they usually ended up arguing and David would take off, sometimes for days.
			Moreover, as their connection grew more distant, Suzanne suspected that David was seeing another woman on the side. Despite
			six months of couple’s therapy including a marital retreat, their marriage remained bitterly painful.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">Suzanne could not bear the loneliness and frustration she felt and finally gathered the strength to leave her marriage.
			She initially called upon me to write an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> to David as a final gesture to possibly salvage
			their relationship. However, as she and I discussed their long-standing and depleted situation, and, more importantly,
			how she must take responsibility for her own happiness, Suzanne began to see the light.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30  mb-10">She soon realized that she was in a dead-end marriage and a self- imposed prison. While she was married to the wrong guy,
			ultimately she created her own reality. The following is her letter to David. This
			<i>Inspired Heart Letter</i> issued David his walking papers and Suzanne’s passage to freedom:</p>

			<p class="mb-10"><i>I would like to share with you that our relationship, the good, the

				has been said, the “most meaningful gifts in life are often wrapped
				in sandpaper.” Our trials and tribulations were indeed painful for

				a fulfilling life with you, (including true love, passion, intimacy,
				commitment, honoring one another, growing through life’s challenges,
				just knowing that, no matter what, we could weather any storm and

			<p class="mb-10"><i>I am also so very grateful to you for allowing me the time and space

			<p class="mb-10"><i>Yes, this whole Suzanne-David episode does seem to have a happier

			<p class="mb-10"><i>You are not, and never were my Prince Charming. But that does not

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">You see, often our most meaningful lessons in life are discovered through emotional trauma or setbacks. Our teachers may
			show up in the most unexpected ways. In Suzanne’s case, while her husband continued to demoralize her, she spent years
			trying to fix their marriage. Yet, no matter what, she could never measure up to his ideals. I believe our soul agrees
			to or invites us into certain painful situations that creates an opportunity to evolve and remember who we truly are:
			someone who is simply Divine, loving, and lovable.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Suzanne had a dramatic awakening as a result of this letter. Truly, she awoke to her own personal power, and moved forward
			with a renewed sense of purpose and passion. This letter is a gift to so many who feel stuck while trying to swim against
			the tide.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">That old saying, <i>When life hands you a lemon, make lemonade, </i> defines the sweetness that is available when we move
			to a higher ground.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-15">GONE WITH THE WIND…</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">They say, “Familiarity Breeds Contempt …” Unfortunately, when the dew is off the rose, and the drudge of predictable or
			“same old — same old” (as in the uninspired, and more routine lifestyle) patterns set in, sadly, much of the</p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">original charm, allure, anticipation, or that element of playfulness, newness and excitation simply vanishes. Instead of
			searching for those lost thrills or surprising one another by creating new ways for keeping the romance alive, the disappointment
			may cause you to acquiesce, blunting your romance into something more mundane, drab, and for some, a buried memory. So,
			as the wildly passionate connection fades away … sometimes the consequence is more than disillusion. It turns into a deep
			resentment. Often the resentment is followed by another fantasy, one that does not include the boring mate, but an obsessive
			wonder regarding whether there is a more perfect someone else to love?</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I’d like to share with you the story of Alena and Darius. This couple each had an interesting cultural background. Alena
			was of Russian heritage and had immigrated from one of the Eastern European Baltic States during her college years. And
			Darius, who was of Turkish descent, grew up on the beautiful island of Cyprus, located on the Mediterranean Sea between
			Greece and Syria. Cyprus is said to be the birthplace of the ancient legendary, Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The couple had been married for nearly ten years, and</p>

			<p class="align_right font-14 mtm-30">|&nbsp;&nbsp; 198 </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">were living in Sedona, Arizona with their two small children, Lars and Tabitha, ages two and six. Sedona is known as a
			sort of Spiritual Mecca for the western United States. People travel from all over to attend every type of “New Age” celebration,
			exploration, psychic fair, art show, or soul expanding retreat. Sedona is a mountain resort town that is bathed in the
			Red Rocks of the Grand Canyon. I happened to be invited to Sedona in order to attend a wonderful event celebrating an
			enlightened living saint who had traveled all the way from Indonesia.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">And that is where I happened to meet Alena, an attractive, petite woman in her early thirties with soft brown eyes, remarkably
			long dark hair, (adorned in a very thick braid), a rather intense Russian accent, and an open, frank demeanor. We easily
			struck up an interesting conversation. She was very intrigued to learn about my passion for ghost-writing as well as
			my own deeper journey for understanding the power of love. At one point she pronounced, “Kristine, I really need your
			help! … I am completely bored with my marriage. I so want to have an affair!”</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Frankly, I was taken back a bit. After all, the event we were at did draw the more “enlightened” folks who were all about
			creating more peace, honor, devotion, and self-evolvement. As Alena further explained her predicament, she</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">199 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">described her husband, Darius, as being a real “Computer Nerd”. She went on to elaborate that their love-life in the bedroom
			was unsatisfactory to say the least. In Alena’s words, “He is so boring! Darius thinks he is an amazing lover, when actually,
			he does nothing for me. I am pleasured through my own wonderful imagination. It is only my imagination that causes me
			to have so many orgasms, not him!”
		</p>


		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">After pondering a bit further, I could not help but mention that her “Computer Nerd” husband did seem like a genuinely
			good guy over-all, not to mention, he was a wonderful provider. As Alena described, they lived in a very charming mini-mansion
			and he was in fact, a devoted father to their children. And, of course she did marry him since she had originally considered
			Darius to be quite lovable. So I asked Alena, “Just how do you and Darius flirt with one another? How does he attempt
			to seduce you? Are you ever drawn to be seductive towards him? And, how do you react when he tries to be alluring or sexually
			playful?”
		</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alena scoffed, “Kristine, we have a wonderful Olympic size swimming pool at home. So we are often taking the children
			to swim. However, Darius sometimes treats me like I am a kid. He splashes me and laughs. Ugh! That is his way of being
			flirtatious.”

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">“And just what is wrong with that?” I queried.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">“Oh, my God, Kristine, he does this when I have just returned from the hair salon. And he is ruining my hair! No, no, no
			… that man is just Not Sexy!”</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alena and I agreed to meet later on during that same week, whereby I was able to interview her further and delve deeper
			into her sense of desperate dissatisfaction. In order to help her resolve this to a better instead of bitter end, I had
			to identify just what were the various elements of love and disenchantment to better understand the overall history and
			trend of their relationship. While their home in Sedona was remarkably lovely, and the local culture attracted a somewhat
			bohemian, artsy crowd that at one time held great appeal to her, from Alena’s perspective, even this “enlightened” mountain
			town had lost its charm over time. The grass for her was greener in Phoenix, and that was a slow, two-hour drive away.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alena shared with me how she adored her kids and she had developed some close friendships with other mothers in her community.
			In fact, she and her friends loved getting together for morning coffee and sharing their stories of travel and adventure
			both before, (when they were single), and after settling down and starting their families. During our conversation, Alena
			laughed when she spoke about the time she had</p>

		<p class="mb-10">urged her husband to take her on a Hawaiian vacation as she longed for a real exotic getaway where she could swim in the
			ocean and feel her toes in the sand. Well, much to her surprise, Darius took the family on a spectacular Hawaiian cruise.
			While exploring the islands, he and Alena actually spent time with a dive master and, in full scuba gear, explored the
			Pacific Ocean from forty feet below and just off the Kona coast. That was just before she became pregnant with their second
			child.
		</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Alena described her husband as being a very dedicated person. He was devoted to the kids. He was proud of his financial
			success. And, spent the majority of his time at home mostly buried behind a computer. It seemed to me, that Alena really
			needed much more attention from her husband. As she shared more about their marriage, it was clear to me that they really
			needed to strike the flint to spark and rejuvenate their sexual chemistry with much more passion and certainly before
			Alena roamed anywhere else. I reminded Alena that, in fact, “it does take two to tango”, and with so much to possibly
			lose, she should try to reclaim their romantic experience with a real effort and focus for the art of seduction.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">By the close of our conversation, Alena was truly excited</p>

		<p class="mb-10">at the prospect of surprising Darius with an <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>. She finally agreed. Instead of blaming her husband,
			perhaps it was up to her to begin to initiate a brand new chapter for their life together. As we discussed “what could
			be”, Alena became hopeful and more confident that she could at least try to harness the power for rebooting their marriage.
			By selecting a new program and pressing the right buttons for turning on the charm, well, anything was possible.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">So, the following message was a relief and a valid gesture for reclaiming a newly revived possibility. It was no longer
			about holding onto bottled-up feelings. Instead, Alena set her resentments aside and allowed the bigger truth, (that was
			buried deeply in her heart), to surface and be set free…</p>

			<p class="mb-10"><i>Darius, I’d like to start by congratulating the two of us … as a family.
				Together, you and I created two beautiful, precious children. Lars
				and Tabitha are gifts of joy. They are our little ones whom we both
				love so dearly. I must say, Darius, you are exceptionally wonderful
				with the kids. You are playful, creative, so loving, and obviously
				committed to making sure they are as happy, safe, and loved as any
				child could ever wish to be. You are certainly treasured for that.</i></p>
			<p class="mb-10"><i>Although this may be out of our usual conversation, I also want
				to acknowledge or indulge you with other compliments for certain
				endearing attributes you show up with. For instance, when I agreed
				to marry you, I knew you were truly a man of honor, intelligence, and
				stability. I can always count on you for being a wonderful provider,

				generous, and reliable. And, I also know you can be surprisingly
				creative when least expected. Do you remember, when I complained
				about needing a romantic or fun vacation like going to Hawaii and
				I really just wanted to get away? You totally surprised me with the
				scuba diving lessons and the amazing Hawaiian vacation. I was so
				impressed with not only your willingness to make me …</i></p>

				what is that? For everyone, love might mean something a bit different.
				I must take responsibility for my own happiness. I’d like to live

				growing closer and, without any reservations, create the best life

			<p class="mb-10"><i>Whether you are comfortable with it or not, Darius, I am growing.
				I am growing out of the need to push you or anyone else away in
				order to maintain a sense of “control.” Instead, I want to lose control,
				with complete abandon, and enjoy a very sensual, fun, and trusting

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Soon after receiving her Inspired Heart Letter, Alena telephoned me with one dramatic request, “OMG, I need to get your

		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I happened to have an extra copy of an earlier, condensed, and unpublished version of this book on hand, and mailed it
			to her that day. And that was that. I did not hear back from Alena for several months. Then, about six months later, I
			received a surprise phone call from her. Alena shared that her life was quite wonderful. Most importantly, she wanted
			me to know that she and her husband are “so in-love!”</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I was quite thrilled for her. I certainly wanted to know what his reaction was to the Inspired Heart Letter. However, Alena

			‘Not yet, Honey. One day you will find it on your pillow… it is such an amazing love letter… I know you will really like
			it. But, not yet!’”</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Naturally, I was very curious. If Alena did not share the letter with her husband, just what inspired the dramatic shift
			in their marriage? Then I asked Alena to please share with me how they have come to resurrect their love. It was as though
			she actually had a song in her heart. With such glee, Alena responded by saying, “Kristine, I read the letter!”</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The fable of this story suggests that instead of blaming our emotional stress, confusion, sadness or indignation on another
			(or making someone else out to be the villain in our “story” or circumstance), perhaps we should look more deeply within
			ourselves in order to discover the real truth. I have said it before, but it still is worth repeating: We learn the most
			about ourselves through our relationships with others.</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">“RAGGEDY ANDY”</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Once, there was a woman, Valery, who held a very important job in a major international import company. She was very bright,
			with an astute business sense, quite attractive, sophisticated, and rather gentle in nature. She enjoyed her high-profile
			position in the financial world and took the demands of her job in stride.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Valery married a gentleman from the British Isles, Andre, who was approximately fifteen years her senior. He was an accomplished
			artist who relocated to her well-appointed luxury home in North Carolina. However, during their six years of marriage,
			Andre had not worked, nor had he financially contributed to their wellbeing. Instead, this lady often complained to her
			close friends that she felt resentful for his lack of responsibility toward shared living expenses.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Not only was he dead weight financially, but he continued to make unreasonable demands of her time and energy. For example,
			after she had worked a twelve-hour day, Andre would call his wife and demand she stop for groceries at the store on her
			way home. (After all, she was already in the car, why should he have to make the extra effort?) Valery and

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">Andre’s arguments and marital dissatisfaction continued to increase, until Valery ran out of steam, and tried to pacify
			the situation.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">One night, Valery recalled opening the refrigerator and a bottle of water flew out and smashed on the floor. Andre immediately
			growled at her to <i>“Clean up the ‘bloody mess’ before I could possibly cut my foot!”</i> Well, instead of chasing him
			around the house with the biggest shard of broken glass, Valery succumbed to his wishes and quickly cleaned up the mess
			without the least snivel. This refined, capable woman was experiencing acute health challenges, such as migraine headaches,
			debilitating back pain, and insomnia.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Her friends implored her to leave this parasite, but she held steadfast hoping her marriage would somehow be successful.
			Perhaps it was just that, an overwhelming fear of failure, since she was such an accomplished winner in other aspects
			of her life. At any rate, despite Valery’s attempts to communicate her angst, the marriage continued to be a source of
			frustration and depletion. Finally, she called upon me to intervene and write an Inspired Heart Letter. It went like this:</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">The heart’s intelligence is said to far outweigh any cognitive, brainbased understanding. The heart inspires us to honor
			our feelings, be creative, and find the silver lining in any predicament. Often, people tend to rely on their brainpower
			to solve situations that may not speak to the heart’s inner compass. When we ignore the stirrings of the heart, that still
			voice within, we are essentially cut off from the neck and thereby emotionally cut off. As mentioned earlier, the care
			and nurturing of relationships is an ongoing investment, negotiation, and responsibility that can offer immense payoffs

			At other times, under a similar circumstance, Neil may become overtly demanding, argumentative, and wreak havoc to the

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The following Inspired Heart Letter was written as a gesture from a lovely woman, Theresa, to her husband, Jack, in order
			to rekindle the spark, the magic, and passionate desire there once was between them. Yes, Theresa and Jack were a devoted

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Theresa considered Jack to be solid, reliable, and a really good father to their kids. However, their lives seemed forever

		<p class="mb-10">frumpy housewife, while she reflected upon the notion,
			<i>Is this all there is?</i> Theresa began to realize that she had nearly forgotten how to be sexy or even flirtatious

			rapport with Jack. She even realized that with so much rushing around and being a responsible mom, she was often too tired
			to even kiss Jack good night, much less respond to his sexual overtures. What’s more, although there was a time when Jack
			could not do enough for her, she couldn’t recall the last time he had given her flowers or even brought her coffee in
			bed.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Before her relationship with Jack slipped entirely away, ending up in a real boring rut, Theresa decided to re-evaluate

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">These key ingredients include: <i>communication, physical intimacy,

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">If I were to capture all of these positive qualities of effective communication, physical intimacy and affection, continued
			respect, and emotional support under all circumstances for a loving relationship into a single concept, it would be trust.
			Trust is the key that feeds and allows all of the aforementioned conditions to exist. Trusting one another in the bedroom,
			in our communication, trusting that we are respected, understood, or emotionally accepted and supported is essential
			for inspiring a true <i>everlasting</i> love reality</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Just how this sense of complete and utter trust is conveyed within the relationship is developed and agreed upon only between
			the partners themselves. What works for one couple, may not be true for another and their relationship. Life is a potpourri
			of flavor and style. However, in the words of William Shakespeare, <i>“To thine own self be true.”</i></p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It cannot be said enough: The gift we give to our partners and ourselves when we are allowed to freely be who we truly

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">On one occasion, rather than ghostwrite an Inspired Heart Letter for Amy, a woman who was having dire marital issues, I
			offered to draw up an outline similar to a Power-Point presentation highlighting her various areas of concern to her husband,
			Brad. This was in preparation for a face-to-face showdown, with full eye contact, sporting a straight spine, and calm,
			unwavering voice. She needed to take command of her own happiness and direction in life.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">This scripted dialogue was a supportive way for Amy to maintain composure, and instead of becoming tongue-tied or derailed,
			she could remain on track with what she needed to express to her obtuse domineering husband. Amy apparently chose a difficult
			path. Unfortunately, it seemed, she chose a husband who needed to feel in control over her. There was a huge disconnect
			between them, and instead of building a solid, loving relationship, their energy was consumed by a</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Often, couples find themselves seriously dumbstruck, and wondering just how they ended up with Mister or Missus Wrong,
			living out a horrifying nightmare in their unfulfilled, frustrated rut. Well, it does take two to tango. Somehow, they
			each signed up for this journey, no matter how awful the consequences. It is only when at least one of the partners wishes
			to step off the merry-go-round that the predictable, exhausting, or even painful, negative pattern comes to a screeching
			halt. But this is also the moment when the valuable gift of positive self-regard and real self-honoring can be born.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Sadly, this particular couple’s marriage, (at least from Amy’s perspective), seemed to be failing across all of the aforementioned
			essential values. There was not much in the way of communication, physical affection/intimacy, respect, or support. However,
			before Amy threw in the towel, she was compelled to tell Brad, once and for all, just how she felt.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Amy usually responded to stressful communications with more of a soft, giggly demeanor. She would turn disappointments
			into jokes, or make light of inappropriate situations and behaviors from others. In reference to the <i>Inspired Heart Letter</i>			approach, whereby the words are carefully designed in such a way as to lend an energetic resonance, with a spoken communication,

			standard and shirk any responsibilities for caring for the emotional wellbeing of your wife. In my
			experience, I see that you do not always
			respect me to my face. (Your foul language, sarcasm, shoving; the

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><i>Note:</i> While this Personal Power-Point oral conversation is a dramatic departure from an Inspired Heart Letter in
			many respects, the actual intention was for this lady to stop sitting on her deeply felt and unhealthy resentment and
			anguish. Rather, this was her opportunity to rise to the occasion, take action, stand up to a bully, and begin to move
			through her anger and discontent. It was imperative for her to begin to openly express herself at a level that may not
			be the optimum, but encompassed a much better sense of self-respect and self-care. Her outrage and anger verbally expressed
			in this more forceful style, was a way for Amy to get in touch with reality. As a result, she was better able to claim
			herself, denounce the icky relationship patterns, and find the strength to move on and move past her unhealthy ways. This
			verbally supported intervention profoundly impacted Amy’s self-confidence. She dared herself to be real… and she won.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">The results of this scripted Personal Power-Point conversation turned out to be a worthwhile way for Amy to finally stand
			up for herself. While she required additional coaching in order to build and maintain her inner resiliency and self-trust,
			her husband, Brad, not only listened attentively, but actually complimented her on how organized, important,</p>

			and forthright their conversation was. Brad also mentioned that he thought it was the most meaningful conversation they had

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">FINDING YOUR VOICE</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I always say that if you feel you cannot do something, just act as though you can. Get out of your own way and grow some
			backbone! A Personal <i>Power-Point</i> presentation can be quite a supportive strategy for clearing the air and really
			giving voice to your experience. It is an excellent way to begin to let go of unrealistic fears, resentment, and lighten
			the emotional load.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">It is important to maintain composure though, so practice, practice, and, well… practice. Although being this verbally
			direct, without much finesse, surely can be rather overwhelming, prepare emotionally for the conversation. In this particular
			case, Amy had been clearly intimidated and had taken on a mouse-like character for so long that we had to consider a strategy
			that would empower her to directly communicate her grievances with conviction.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Returning to the idea that life is theater and we are all actors upon the stage, perhaps some folks need to try out for</p>

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">245 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">a different role. In this case, I suggested to Amy that she begin to consider herself as queen of her own castle, and actually
			envision an imaginary crown upon her head. After all, she certainly seemed to be living with a royal pain in the ass!
			Perhaps it was about time she stopped and considered her bottom line. Is it worth all of the pain and humiliation she
			had succumbed to in this marriage?</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Decide what your own deal-breaker is. Relationships serve as mirrors that reflect our innermost feelings regarding how
			much we value ourselves.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I maintain that our teachers often come onto our path at times disguised as mean, demoralizing, controlling, <i>chi vampires</i>			who can suck out our very life force if allowed. The gift in this type of encounter proves that once someone stands up
			to a bully, no longer is he or she interested or fearful of the bully’s reaction, and thereby the dynamic changes and
			the negativity subsides or disappears altogether. Often, this causes a new paradigm shift whereby the relationship may
			dramatically improve or morph into a more empowered marital bond. Other times, it causes a loss of the unhealthy connection
			altogether resulting in each person taking a separate path. <i>Que sera,</i> sera! Either way, there is a real opportunity
			for increased self-awareness and personal growth.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">To further illustrate the four attributes of love that are the fundamental building blocks for a more solid foundation
			of trust in any partnership, here is a brief overview:</p>

		<h4 class="relation_heading_text1 mb-20">THE FOUR AGREEMENTS FOR A LOVING RELATIONSHIP</h4>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Communication:</b> Paying attention and listening from the heart are some of the most important features for effectively
			communicating. There is a real art to listening. This is a talent that does not always come naturally. There is a genuine
			gift in allowing our significant others to feel truly heard. While some people may be more focused on being right rather
			than being loved, so much more is to be gained by honoring one another both in giving and receiving heartfelt communications.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">
			Instead of feeling as though you are egg-walking or dancing around a sensitive, difficult topic, stuffing your feelings,
			or even worse, blurting out your thoughts, creating regular occasions for verbal exchange before little snags or issues
			become big deals is simply wise. Realistically, talking it out is not always an even, or balanced, give-and-take communication
			especially when emotions are high or the ego is engaged.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">
			Sometimes, there is strength in taking a time-out,</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>

			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">247 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> or giving oneself time and physical distance to consider all aspects of the problem at hand and mentally and/or emotionally
			being able to process the situation before expounding on your position. Typically, at any given moment, the balance of
			your conversation may be uneven. However, by being compassionate and open to your partner, the conversations will, most
			likely, become more balanced. Then the notion of controlling the conversation becomes outmoded and is replaced by a mutual
			engagement instead of a power play.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">
			One couple I admire comes to mind. Kimberly and Ron have been happily married for over twenty-five years. At the start of
			their marriage, they made a commitment to have a weekly bubble-bath date. The bubblebath setting was a private, relaxing
			space. The purpose of this was simply to listen and express how they were feeling, to air what concerns they may have,
			and to comment upon what they appreciate about one another or about life in general. They also made a pact that they would
			always refrain from using foul language or derogatory name-calling. You see, they deliberately marked certain boundaries
			and invested energy toward growing and maintaining the business of their marriage. Together, they continue to focus on
			their main priority, which is their life together.

		</div>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Physical Intimacy and/or Affection: </b>When resentment sets in, one of the first places to find this is in the bedroom.
			Withholding affection or sex, or in certain instances, forcing a partner to engage in sexual acts against their will,
			is a prelude to doom. You already knew that!</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">
			Power plays in the bedroom may be an easy way to assert control, but is this really what you want to do? This manner of control
			can actually backfire. Hesitation to share sex may be an expression of fear, to work through with your partner, but to
			intentionally withhold sex and affection can be a harsh tool, or weapon, that unfortunately can be used at whim. It expresses
			resistance to being vulnerable. The essence of love is a willingness to freely expose your heart, your body, and all your
			senses. Sexual, or intimate, encounters involve surrender or trust at the deepest, most private, personal level.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">When you feel absolutely safe in the arms of your partner, this naturally opens the door to a deeper experience of sensuality
			and exploration. Lovemaking, in every sense of the word, is joyous and wonderfully fulfilling when we not only desire
			our partner, but likewise feel desired by them. After all, this is a physical communion. With healthy physical intimacy,
			we are allowed to share a part of ourselves that is</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">249 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">expressed and received with a type of freedom and exclusivity that feels completely accepted, enjoyed, and turns us on
			to desire.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Conversely, withholding or rationing sex is a passive-aggressive symptom often based upon hostility and anger. Direct acts
			of cruelty, humiliation, or acting out in spiteful ways in the bedroom such as sharing your sexual fantasies regarding
			lusting after someone else, or criticizing your lover’s physicality or sexual performance, surely squelches any sense
			of real intimacy and can inhibit your partner’s willingness to fully enjoy your sexual experience. Everyone has the right
			to discover and live in a comfortable, sharing, and private zone. At times, navigating through the twilight, or middle
			zone, may be somewhat awkward, yet together the couple eventually determines their own comfort level, or the atmosphere
			for lovemaking and physical affection that allows each to feel safe and free.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Talk fearlessly about your desires and limitations, and encourage your partner to do the same. Sexual expression has a
			life of its own. It flows and fluctuates into continuous cycles and changes to various states over time; otherwise it
			becomes too predictable, stagnate, and uninspired. Like a menu, you may want to try various selections, depending upon
			what piques your interest at the time. The soup de jour</p>

		<p class="mb-10">may be worth trying as long as you trust the chef and when you already know that the service is fabulous.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Naturally, good communication is foreplay to good sex. The seduction, the foreplay itself, is what seasons the intimacy,
			or the nature of your lovemaking. What’s more, the aftermath, or dessert, whether it is conversation, holding one another,
			falling asleep in each other’s arms, or sharing a bowl of ice cream, sweetens the whole encounter.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">I contend that physical attraction, or having chemistry with another, is actually a barometer for our soul’s alignment
			with one another. If couples evolve together over time, then they remain more aligned. That is quite promising for everlasting
			partnership. However, there are times when one partner simply outgrows his or her connection to their significant other
			and the relationship, or at least the relationship’s dynamic, shifts or ends. These changes in course or final endings
			can be quite devastating, especially when there is time invested or children involved.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Emotional Support: </b>One of the best reasons for getting married or remaining in a committed, exclusive relationship
			is that sense of being part of a partnership or team. Creating and striving for common goals includes sharing</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">251 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10">your resources for the common good of the couple or family, and emotionally relaxing, since you know you are no longer
			out there howling at the moon, trying to figure life out on your own. So, yes, that ultimate sense of security, social
			identity, and inner sense of connection is what can make the commitment of marriage so attractive. As part of the human
			experience, we naturally desire and search for or attract our soul mate or that special person with whom we will find
			a true sense of belonging.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Creating your life together may involve making important decisions or going through certain experiences such as buying
			a house, planning vacations, having children, inheriting stepchildren and in-laws, or building careers. You’ll enjoy growing
			a social circle that may very well include other couples, sharing hobbies or fun activities, celebrating holidays and
			special occasions together, all the while creating sweet memories and your own family legacy</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Underlying this idealistic notion for being a couple is the reliance upon one another in times when we feel vulnerable
			through life’s challenges, or when we are hit with a whammy, such as when unexpected sadness, devastation, or misery occurs.
			For instance, life’s passages may, at times, be fraught by challenges, including health issues, death of loved ones,

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> accidents, job losses, financial distress, worry, doubt, or even natural disasters. Working through stormy times together,
			no matter what, is one of the supportive pillars to the marital foundation.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">In the business of marriage, include one another in all decisions instead of trying to protect the other by withholding
			the truth or your feelings. Keep the window open and resolve to maintain honesty above all else. This fuels deeper intimacy
			and emotional growth and maintains your heartfelt connection to one another. When we are clear about each of our intentions
			and we are compassionate to our partner’s individual process, for example, their experience of becoming a parent, career
			challenges, health issues, aging, etc., then we are able to offer the sense of acceptance, encouragement, and understanding,
			or the emotional support that is a true measure of love.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10"><b>Respect: </b> Feeling allowed to express who you are without feeling that your partner is going to condemn you or run
			away allows you to be or live in your own true nature. This encourages each partner to avoid hiding behind the truth with
			certain game-playing tactics, such as manipulation by acts of deception, pretending, or denial. Each relationship subscribes
			to its particular set of emotional and physical boundaries.</p>
		<mbp:pagebreak />
		<div class="mb-40">
			<p class="align_center font-14">RELATIONSHIFT</p>
			<p class="align_left font-14 mtm-30">253 &nbsp;&nbsp;| </p>

		</div>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Certain couples may seem to have stricter or looser boundaries than the expected norm. Nevertheless, the deal-breaker behaviors
			must be established and agreed upon from the start. It is wise to establish and secure the rules for acceptable behaviors
			on the marital playground. Demonstrate respect for one another and agree upon how each partner will honor their mutual
			values. Just as the couple previously discussed, Kimberly and Ron, made a verbal commitment and acted upon their agreement
			to always address each other respectfully.</p>


		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Maintain those bubble-bath meetings or your <i>very own special,
			exclusive time together</i> to air any thoughts and feelings with safety. Each couple should create a pact for rendering
			a clear understanding of what feels respectful and what does not. This promise for maintaining mutual respect and honoring
			is what keeps our hearts feeling open and secure. It is up to each couple and their agreement for acceptable social decorum
			and what is considered an indiscretion, or foul play.</p>

		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Respectful behaviors may, at times, call for denying a particular urge, such as flirting with someone at the office, unilaterally
			making plans without informing your partner, or complaining about your partner to others outside of the marriage. Further,
			the couple must decide for themselves

		<p class="mb-10">
			regarding matters of privacy, such as email, internet access, personal privacy for bathing, grooming, toiletry, opposite-sex
			friendships, standing up for one another, and being mutually supportive as a couple socially. This may include: encounters
			with in-laws or extended family members, business or professional gatherings, social events, taking separate vacations,
			and enjoying separate hobbies or activities. Just as noted in Chapter 2 regarding the “Stevie Wonder” letter, attending
			a social engagement together only to find your partner conversing and dancing with other strange women or men while you
			are left alone, for many individuals, is quite unacceptable.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Family matters, including issues regarding child rearing, are more successful when the parents are working as a united
			front and not undermining one another. Otherwise, this only causes confusion, resentment, and gives the child opportunities
			for possible manipulation, or worse, feeling emotionally unsafe. Remember, it is very important to maintain mutual respect
			while focusing on ways to compromise and solve problems. Money matters – how the couple saves, spends, and shares their
			income – is another area that must be mutually agreed upon and followed.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">To expect that each partner is going to want to do everything together, to always enjoy the same activities, and</p>

		</div>
		<p class="mb-10"> otherwise need to always be together may be quite unrealistic. Therefore, respecting each other’s time, need for space,
			and individual interests should be part of a working agreement.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Avoid other ingredients for failure like using foul language, engaging in name-calling and other forms of verbal intimidation,
			such as threatening or issuing ultimatums, being too bossy or acting like a dictator. Conversely, manipulating through
			tears, locking oneself in the bathroom, or driving off in a huff only creates more drama and disconnection.
		</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Do not indulge in undermining your partner or taking the path of least resistance by ignoring or placating your partner.
			Refuse to tolerate bad behavior and other ways of disrespecting yourself in the partnership. These types of unhealthy
			dynamics are always power struggles. For example, if one partner is a “control freak” and the other partner is a “mouse”,
			or if one partner stands by and allows the other to act in inappropriate ways, this is a true indicator that the marriage,
			or partnership, is deeply troubled by a sense of insecurity or lack of trust. Moreover, any type of verbal or physical
			abuse is a definite deal-breaker and should never be tolerated under any circumstance.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Healthy communication, gratifying sexual or physical affection, emotional support, and respect are essential</p>

		<p class="mb-10">elements in any union. When put in place correctly, they take root for securing a solid foundation.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-10">Most important, couples should never stop courting one another. Love is kept alive when couples are flirtatious, complimentary,
			genuinely interested in each other, playful, romantic, sensual, and seductive. Investing in the quality of the relationship,
			including: sharing ample time for being together, just relating, (or the process of giving and receiving without any agenda
			beyond that compelling urge to simply enjoy time spent together), honors their union and blesses their marriage or partnership.</p>
		<p class="relation_text_indent_30 mb-20">What we do not effort toward or earn, we more often do not give as much value to. Couples who are mindful and conscientious
			without demoralizing or minimizing one another, without forsaking one another, and without neglecting the emotional responsibility
			for nurturing the relationship, find success. Making their marriage the ultimate priority supports the sanctity of their
			vows to always love, honor, and cherish one another under all circumstances.</p>

				in your work. My hope, Sweetheart, is that you will share your
				feelings with me. Know that our home is a safe haven, and apart
				from any stress that your workday brings. I am here for you, Tom.
				I do want the most perfect marriage we can manage. I want our
				children to be proud of us. I see myself as the jewel in your crown.
				Thanks for opening your big, beautiful heart to me. Just as Carl Sandberg was quoted in our
				nuptials, “I love you for who you are…
				I love you more for who we will become.”</i></p>
